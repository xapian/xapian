<Description>
This contains a simple GUI, using GTK and libglade.
It is known to work with GTK version 1.2.6 and libglade version 0.7

This GUI demonstrates the retrieval and relevance feedback parts of
Muscat.

Currently it fails to work with DA files: there appears to be some memory
corruption somewhere, and reading DA files either results in a consistency
check error within the DA reading code, or simply in a segfault and core
dump.

Whether this is the fault of the DA file reading code or a bug somewhere
within libglade is currently unknown.
