README for xapdep
-----------------

Charlie Hull/Lemur Consulting Ltd. Feb 16th 2010

Xapdep is a replacement for makedepend which was used previously for 
calculating dependency information for Xapian when compiled with MSVC.
The compiler allows a switch -showIncludes which generates a list of 
dependencies, xapdep reads this, tidies them up and adds them to the end 
of a Makefile.

See win32_common.mak and others for details of how xapdep is used. Note that
this program works with fixed filenames and thus only in a particular set of
circumstances.
