Xapian $version can now be downloaded from:

https://xapian.org/download

This release is mainly composed of
optimisations,
FIXME
and
bug fixes.

The wiki has the usual summary of the most notable changes:

https://trac.xapian.org/wiki/ReleaseOverview/$version

A big thanks to
FIXME
for helping to make this release a reality.

If I've missed anyone out, you can claim an extra big thankyou.

As always, if you encounter problems, please report them here, or to
the bug-tracker: https://xapian.org/bugs

You can find detached GPG signatures for each of the release tarballs
in a corresponding file with ".asc" appended.

Here are the SHA256 checksums of the released files:
