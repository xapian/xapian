NEWS - list of user-visible changes between releases of GNU Libtool

New in 2.2.4: 2008-05-04: CVS version 2.2.3a, Libtool team:

* New features:

  - New libtoolize option --no-warn, for users that want to continue to
    use old libtool style without being nagged.
  - Options --debug, --no-warn, --quiet and --verbose can be passed to
    libtoolize through the environment variable LIBTOOLIZE_OPTIONS, for
    cleaner interaction between the user and libtoolize when called by
    autoreconf.

* Bug fixes:

  - The documentation for lt_dlopenadvise showed the wrong type for
    the lt_dladvise parameter.
  - The public declarations for lt_dlhandle and lt_dladvise are now
    incomplete struct types rather than void*, which means that nearly
    all casting is eliminated allowing the compiler to provide more
    type checking.
  - libtoolize no longer reports up-to-date files that it would have
    copied, unless --force is passed.
  - No longer reports that lt~obsolete.m4 needs to be added to aclocal.m4
    when it is already there.
  - When `aclocal' copied the libtool macros directly into `aclocal.m4'
    (i.e. AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR is not being used), libtoolize no longer
    reports that all macros need to be added to `aclocal.m4', and
    diagnoses only the macro files that are missing or not up-to-date.
  - libtoolize now advises use of AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR to keep matching
    libtool macros in-tree where appropriate.
  - libtoolize now advises use of `ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4' (or
    equivalent) where appropriate, and errors out when ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS
    names a different directory to AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR.

New in 2.2.2: 2008-04-01: CVS version 2.2.1a, Libtool team:

* New features:

  - In compile mode, compiler output occurs in the user locale.  This
    feature has been present in 1.5.26 but not in 2.2.

* Changes in supported systems or compilers:

  - Initial shared library support for AmigaOS4 on powerpc.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fix 2.2 regression in libltdl that causes memory corruption upon
    repeated `lt_dlinit(); lt_dlexit()'.
  - Fix 2.2 regression in libltdl that skipped the dlopen loader if
    the system also supports other loaders (e.g., Cygwin, HP-UX).
  - Fix 2.2 regression in that `libtool --mode=execute CMD ARGS' does not
    transform ARGS that do not look like shell or C wrappers of libtool
    programs.
  - Fix 2.2 regression that kept cross-compiling to w32 from working.
  - Several testsuite issues have been fixed, thanks to user feedback.

New in 2.2: 2008-03-01; CVS version 2.1c, Libtool team:

* Bug fixes:

  - argz.c, lt__dirent.c and lt__strl.c are correctly distributed with
    parent projects using nonrecursive libltdl.
  - libtoolize no longer tries to install libtool files when libltdl is
    used in a non-autoconf parent package.
  - Don't add the CXX tag to libtool when there is no C++ compiler, even
    if AC_PROG_CXX sets a default g++ compiler where no such compiler
    actually exists.
  - make distcheck DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS=--disable-ltdl-install
    works again.

New in 2.1b: 2008-02-01; CVS version 2.1a, Libtool team:

* Important incompatible changes and obsoleted features:

  - Removed deprecated APIs from libltdl: lt_dlcaller_register,
    lt_dlhandle_next, lt_dlhandle_find, lt_dlforeach, lt_dlmutex_register,
    lt_dlmutex_lock, lt_dlmutex_unlock, lt_dlmutex_seterror,
    lt_dlmutex_geterror, lt_dlmalloc, lt_dlrealloc, lt_dlfree.
  - The Libtool and libltdl macros and the testsuite now assume a C89
    environment, consequently do not test for headers such as string.h,
    strings.h, memory.h any more.
  - Fix regression in libltdl symbol exports on Cygwin. Side effect:
    LT_GLOBAL_DATA and LT_SCOPE are now explicitly defined as
    declspec(dllexport), bypassing auto-export logic on Cygwin.
    This tracks existing behavior on MinGW.
  - The libtool script has been optimized a bit for more modern shells.
    This breaks use of the stdin file descriptor in libtool, and can
    break if a different shell is used to execute the libtool script
    than the one it was configured for.
  - The macros AC_ENABLE_SHARED, AC_DISABLE_SHARED, AC_ENABLE_STATIC, and
    AC_DISABLE_STATIC have been un-deprecated after deprecation in
    1.9b.
  - The macro LT_WITH_LTDL has been renamed to LTDL_INIT.
  - Fixed a branch-1-5/HEAD regression to only link uninstalled libraries
    statically with `-static'.  In order to compensate for this, there
    is a new link flag `-static-libtool-libs' to provide the previous
    `-static' semantics.

* New features:

  - Fix installation of libltdl so that it does not need Autoconf and
    Automake installed, in order to be usable in another package.  This
    lifts the restrictions introduced in 1.9b.
  - Default convenience or installable libltdl builds can optionally
    be declared using new `convenience' or `installable' options to the
    LTDL_INIT macro (as an alternative to individual LTDL_CONVENIENCE
    or LTDL_INSTALLABLE invocations).
  - New configure-time options to allow libltdl parent project builder
    to choose between installed and shipped libltdl, when invoking
    LTDL_INIT: --with-included-ltdl, --with-ltdl-include,
    --with-ltdl-lib.
  - New LT_CONFIG_LTDL_DIR macro to specify a different directory name
    for a convenience libltdl.
  - libtoolize has been completely overhauled.
  - `libtoolize --install' now also installs `install-sh'.
  - New libtoolize options: --non-recursive, --recursive, --subproject.
    These options control the way libltdl is installed into a package by
    libtoolize.  The new recursive and non-recursive build modes for
    libltdl don't require a subconfigure any more.
    The Libtool package itself builds libltdl nonrecursively.
  - The 'nonrecursive', 'recursive' and 'subproject' libltdl build
    modes are given as LTDL_INIT options.
  - New make variable LTDLDEPS for use in output_DEPENDENCIES.
  - New multi-module-loader safe libltdl handle iteration APIs:
    lt_dlhandle_iterate, lt_dlhandle_fetch, lt_dlhandle_map.
  - New lt_dlinterface_register to maintain separation of concerns
    between modules loaded by different libraries.
  - New lt_dlopenadvise takes a new lt_dladvise type argument, which
    lets the caller request local or global symbol visibility from the
    module loader with lt_dladvise_local and lt_dladvise_global
    respectively.  If neither is given, or if lt_dlopen (or lt_dlopenext)
    are called, then the system default module symbol visibility is used.
  - The new lt_dladvise_init/lt_dladvise_destroy based APIs also allow
    caller requests for a filename extension search with lt_dladvise_ext,
    and for marking a module unloadable with lt_dladvise_resident.
  - Allow shell special characters like `$' in source file names, but
    not in object names, to enhance GCJ support.
  - An entire new Autotest-based testsuite in addition to the old one.
    Both testsuites have been made more useful for testing
    cross-compilers.  The new testsuite exposes many more issues, but
    may also be a little rocky on exotic systems.
  - In 1.9b, a new variable inherited_linker_flags has been added to the
    libtool library files.  This variable takes flags that should be
    used by dependent libraries and programs, but that do not fit into
    `dependency_libs' for both clarity and backward-compatibility.

* Changes in supported systems or compilers:

  - Removed bitrotted support for xlc on Mac OS X.
  - Detection of compiler wrappers distcc/ccache and $host_alias prefix.
  - Basic support for PIE (position-independent executables).
  - Support for DragonFly BSD, improved support for FreeBSD.
  - Improved support for GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/NetBSD.
  - Support for Interix 3 (Windows SFU) and newer versions.
  - Support for AIX 6.1.
  - Improved support for UnixWare.
  - Initial support for RDOS.
  - Initial Support for FC (modern Fortran).
  - Support for Portland Group compiler, the Sun compiler suite on GNU/Linux,
    and initial support for the IBM compiler suite on GNU/Linux/ppc.
  - Support for linux-dietlibc (`diet' as well as `diet-dyn', separately).
  - Building libltdl with a C++ compiler has been undusted.
  - On (AIX?,) HP-UX, and OpenBSD, hardcoding has been changed to prefer
    rpath over absolute dependent library names.  This fixes DESTDIR
    installs, among others, on the non-HP-UX/PA systems.
  - Use of C++ templates together with shared libraries has been
    improved on some systems and with some compilers, but is still
    ongoing work.  Feedback is desirable here.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fix libltdl on static platforms.
  - Search paths with GCC on multilib systems like x86_64 have been fixed.
  - Fixed a regression that prevented use of libltdl without autotools.
  - Fix error with -version-info on systems with version_type=none, such
    as BeOS.
  - Fix symbol exporting for cases where command line length limits are
    exceeded.
  - Improve linking with C++ libraries on Solaris with Sun compiler.
  - Fix installation of libraries that are required by installation
    commands such as `ln' or `rm'.
  - More robust parsing of mangled `.la' files inside libltdl, fixing a
    possible overrun and a crash due to memory exhaustion.
  - Fix compile command line for gcj on MinGW.
  - Some configure variables have been renamed to fix caching:
    lt_prog_compiler_pic_works to lt_cv_prog_compiler_pic_works
    lt_prog_compiler_static_works to lt_cv_prog_compiler_static_works.
  - Fix 1.9b regression: lt_dlopen(NULL) works on AIX again.
  - Loads of smaller bug fixes.


New in 1.9f: 2004-10-23; CVS version 1.9e, Libtool team:
* Fix a regression in 1.9d, where ECHO was always set to 'echo' and the
  backslash quoting tests were never run.
* Fix a regression in 1.9d, where progpath was used for --no-reexec before it
  was set.
* Fix a regression in 1.9d, which required an installed automake to build the
  bootstrapped tarball.
* Fix hanging bug on MinGW.

New in 1.9d: 2004-10-03; CVS version 1.9c, Libtool team:
* If non-pic objects were not compiled, and libtool is called in link mode,
  libtool no longer silently creates an empty archive, but rather falls
  back to pic objects.
* When compiling C glue code with $LTCC, libtool now saves the setting of
  $compiler_flags from the C tag, and passes those flags to $LTCC.
* libtool no longer dies when concurrently creating directories with
  `make -j' on multi-processor hosts.
* Return type, and name parameter of lt_dlloader_remove are no longer
  `const'.
* Name parameter of lt_dlloader_find is no longer 'const'.
* The API for the slist ADT has been updated: slist_new has been replaced
  by slist_box; slist_unbox and slist_sort are new; the footprint of
  slist_remove and slist_fnid have changed; SListCallback and SListCompare
  types have been exchanged.  See libltdl/slist.c for documentation.
* libltdl is C89 compatible again.  lt_dlsymbol type removed, and lt_dlsymlist
  structure changed to avoid using C99 flexible arrays.
* Support self dlopening for executables on cygwin and mingw.
* Improved support for linux-gnu/ia64.
* Initial support for s390x-ibm-tpf.
* Fixed some memory leaks in libltdl.
* Improved support for OpenBSD (use rpath instead of hardcoding absolute
  file names).

New in 1.9b: 2004-08-29; CVS version 1.5a, Libtool team:
* The /^_?LT_[A-Z_]+$/ namespace is now reserved for Libtool's own macros.
  If you have any shell variables in this namespace they will need to be
  renamed.  If you have any macros in this namespace please rename them to
  prevent any possible future clash with libtool supplied macros.
* New LT_PREREQ macro for specifying minimum libtool requirement.
* New LT_INIT interface replaces AC_PROG_LIBTOOL, AC_ENABLE_SHARED,
  AC_DISABLE_SHARED, AC_ENABLE_STATIC, AC_DISABLE_STATIC,
  AC_ENABLE_FAST_INSTALL, AC_DISABLE_FAST_INSTALL, AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN,
  AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL and AC_LIBTOOL_PIC_MODE.  Use autoupdate to modernise
  your configure.ac files after installing this release.
* New LT_LANG interface to enable libtool support for a specific language.
* Language support is now only included if your configure.ac enables it,
  either through a call to AC_PROG_CXX etc. or LT_LANG.
* The libtool script will complain if it was built from mismatched ltmain.sh
  and libtool m4 macro versions.
* Like automake, libtoolize no longer installs config.guess and config.sub by
  default.  Use new --install option to get the old behaviour.
* libtoolize no longer supports the --ltdl-tar option.
* libtool script is now created by config.status.  Instead of interrogating
  `./libtool' from configure.ac after calling AC_PROG_LIBTOOL, use the
  variable names directly.
* libltdl is no longer a self-contained package, and shares configury with
  the top level directory now.
* Shared objects (.lo) are no longer created when `-static' is passed in
  compile mode.
* New compile mode option `-shared' prevents creation of static objects (.o).
* New link mode option `-shared' creates only shared libraries at link time.
* If you configure libtool with --disable-shared (or if libtool does not
  support shared libraries on your platform) trying to build a library using
  `-shared' is a fatal error.
* New link mode option `-weak' tells libtool when not to propogate dependency
  libraries from dlpreopened modules.
* libtoolize installs libtool.m4, (ltdl.m4 if used,) and various supporting
  m4 definitions to AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR.
* Mode inferrence removed, shorthand for choosing modes added.
* Specifying -allow-undefined is now an error.
* Speed up max_cmd_len check.
* libltdl can now preopen modules from within a library, and libtool will
  accept -dlpreopen options when linking either a shared library or a
  convenience library.
* New function in libltdl: lt_dlhandle_find provides access to module handles
  by module name.
* New function in libltdl: lt_dlpreload_open opens all preloaded modules.
* libltdl no longer loads shared libraries with global symbol resolution,
  this caused problems when the symbols were intended to be overriden further
  up the stack; it is also not recommended practice.
* New function in libltdl: lt_dlhandle_first, primes handle iterations (using
  lt_dlhandle_next) to filter by module interface.
* libltdl no longer tries to support multi-threaded programming with
  lt_dlmutex_register(), which was unusable with POSIX threads anyway.
  The symbols are deprecated but exported for backwards compatibility.
* libltdl no longer uses lt_dlmalloc, lt_dlrealloc and lt_dlfree.  The symbols
  are still exported for backwards compatibility.
* The lt_dlinfo struct has a new module field that can be used by dlloaders.
* libltdl no longer supports pre-c89 compilers.  Some of the pre89 portability
  functions had compile time bugs in them anyway, so you guys can't have been
  using it :-)
* make install now deletes preexisting $prefix/share/libtool before installing
  latest files.
* Extracting symbols from an import library on cygwin and win32 now works.
* Initial support for amigaos-ppc.
* Improved support for OpenBSD.
* Support for Intel C++ version 8.0.
* New support for IBM's xlc and xlc++ on Mac OS X.
* Finished support for QNX RTOS.

  calls itself for relinking etc.
* `-pthread' and similar options are honoured when linking shared libraries.
* -no-suppress in compile mode shows compiler output for both PIC and non-PIC
  object compilation.
* New link mode option `-precious-files-regex' to prevent accidental removal
  of files you want to keep, such as test coverage data, from the temporary
  output directory.
* Directories specified in /etc/ld.so.conf are no longer hardcoded on GNU/Linux.

New in 1.2f: 1999-03-15; CVS version 1.2e, Libtool team:
* libtool will correctly link uninstalled libraries into programs
  and prefer uninstalled libraries to installed ones
* Library paths that are in the system default run-time search path
  are no longer hardcoded into executables.
* New fast installation mode, which links the final executable
  in order to avoid relinking during installation.
  Programs in the build-tree are relinked when executed.
* New AC_DISABLE_FAST_INSTALL macro to set the default for
  the fast-install mode to disabled
* New -export-symbols-regex flag, to export symbols selectively by
  a regular expression
* Support -R for specifying run-time path of programs and library dependencies
* New -avoid-version option to avoid versioning for libraries
* libtool module names no longer need to have a "lib" prefix
  (requires automake 1.4).
* New -thread-safe flag, to build thread-safe libraries
* Major improvements in libltdl: API documentation, installable version,
  support for module search paths, support for lt_dlopen(0),
  can be embedded into packages as a tar file (libltdl.tar.gz),
  dynamic buffer allocation and buffer overflow checks,
  new macro LTDL_SET_PRELOADED_SYMBOLS() which must be used in the
  main program, dynamic memory allocation functions are user-defineable
* New AC_LIBLTDL_CONVENIENCE and AC_LIBLTDL_INSTALLABLE macros, to select
  convenience and/or installable versions of libltdl.
* libltdl is now built and installed unless --disable-ltdl-install
* New "-dlopen self" flag for dlopening the executable itself
* New AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN macro to check for dlopen support,
  required if you use -dlopen or -dlpreopen
* If libtool could not satisfy all dependencies of a module
  it will only build a static version of it
* dld_preloaded_symbols was renamed to lt_preloaded_symbols
* Support for BeOS
* Improved support for FreeBSD, AIX, IRIX, OSF, SysV 4.3, HP/UX, DJGPP
  BSD/OS 4.x and NetBSD
* In order for libtool to attempt to link a shared library (dll) on win32
  platforms, you must pass the -no-undefined flag to libtool in link mode.
* The path to GNU ld now works on cygwin-b18 to cygwin-b20.2 at least.
* Support for IRIX library versioning.
* New demos and tests
* Various bugfixes

New in 1.2d: 1998-12-16; CVS version 1.2c, Libtool team:
* libtool will correctly link already-installed libraries into programs.
* New -module flag, to create loadable modules.
* New libltdl, a small library for portable dlopening of modules.
  It is still undocumented, but you can already find some examples in:
* New mdemo directory, with tests of -module and dlopening examples.
  Be aware that libltdl is only known to work on a few platforms such as
  GNU/Linux and Solaris2.  Some mdemo tests are known to FAIL on several
  other platforms; please ignore these failures by now (or work to fix
  them :-).
* Inter-library dependencies patch finally integrated, but there's
  still much porting to do.  See PORTING for details (some plans for the
  future in mail/deplibs in the CVS tree).
* New option -export-symbols to control symbol exporting when possible.
* Fixed -export-dynamic problem with C++ programs in egcs 1.1.
* New dlpreopen structure.
* libtool now supports `-c -o' and subdirectories in sources and
  target object names even in platforms whose compilers do not support
  this.  In this case, file locking occurs to avoid problems with
  parallel builds.
* New `echo' variant that should fix most problems with long command
  lines and broken printf programs.
* Support for DG/UX, UnixWare 7.x and FreeBSD 3.0, and improved
  support for Microsoft Windows
* Various bugfixes
* We now have anonymous CVS access to GNU libtool.  CVSROOT is
  :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.gnu.org:/gd/gnu/anoncvsroot.  The password
  is empty.  The directory is libtool.  Check our home-page at
  http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html for details.
* Alexandre Oliva, Thomas Tanner and Gary V. Vaughan have taken over
  the maintenance of libtool.
* Arguments to ltconfig have been changed to allow creation of a
  libtool C program, totally unusable as of this release.

New in 1.2b - 1998-07-01, Gordon Matzigkeit:
* Libtool needs a new maintainer, since Gordon Matzigkeit has quit.
  If you think you can do the job, send mail to bug-libtool@gnu.org.
* Bug fixes.
* Support for libtool convenience archives.

New in 1.2a - 1998-04-19, Gordon Matzigkeit:
* Bug fixes.
* ltconfig accepts an `--output' option to specify the name of the
  generated libtool.
* New `--debug' flag to turn on shell script tracing for libtool,
  libtoolize, and ltconfig.
* Added `libtool --config' to print out all configuration variables.
* Support for *-*-hpux11*.

New in 1.2 - 1998-03-20, Gordon Matzigkeit:
* Minor bug fixes to provide a stable public release.
* Libtool no longer cseses Solaris printf to barf due to silly
  2110-byte static buffers.

New in 1.1 - 1998-03-08, Gordon Matzigkeit:
* Bug fixes.
* http://www.profitpress.com/libtool/ is libtool's homepage.
* `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL' supports turning shared or static libraries off
  with the `--enable-shared=PKGS' and `--enable-static=PKGS' configure
  flags.  See (libtool)AM_PROG_LIBTOOL.
* Use the `AM_DISABLE_SHARED' or `AM_DISABLE_STATIC' macros if you
  wish to modify the default behaviour of `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL' for your
  package.
* New rules for `AM_PROG_LD' to use gcc's `-print-prog-name' flag in
  order to find ld, if possible.
* Suppress duplicate compiler output during `compile' mode.
* Deleted `dlname' mode.  Dlopen applications should only use the
  runtime search method described in (libtool)Finding the dlname.
* Experimental support for dynamically loaded modules, even on
  static-only platforms, via new `-dlopen' and `-dlpreopen' link
  flags.
* `compile' mode honours the `-static' flag to prevent libtool
  from building PIC objects.
* New `execute' mode to support debugging uninstalled libtool
  libraries and executables.
* `-allow-undefined' is now the default.  You can use `-no-undefined'
  to declare that a shared library is completely self-contained.
* Inter-library dependencies are automatically handled when linking
  against an uninstalled `.la' file.
* New `-all-static' flag to prevent any dynamic linking.  The regular
  `-static' flag now just prevents dynamic linking of libtool libraries.
* New `-release' flag to encode release numbers into libtool
  libraries.  This breaks binary compatibility, but is useful for
  libraries whose interfaces change very frequently.  See
  (libtool)Versioning.
* The `-rpath' flag can be used to hardcode absolute directories when
  linking executables using libtool.
* New robust quoting code to handle any metacharacters passed in
  arguments to libtool commands.
* Full support for broken collect2 on AIX 3.  Shared libraries
  can now be built with all working versions of GCC on AIX.
* Shell script speed optimizations for old and buggy /bin/sh systems,
  such as HP-UX 9 and SunOS 4.1.4.
* Maybe use `_libs' as a temporary libtool directory instead of `.libs'
  in order to cope with MS-DOS filenames.
* Portability fixes for Windows NT.
* Refuse to create libtool libraries that don't begin with `lib'.
  This allows us to correctly handle OSes that don't have the `lib'
  prefix by default, such as OS/2.
* Support for *-*-amigaos*, *-*-os2*, *-*-sysv4.2uw2*, and *-*-uts4*.

New in 1.0 - 1997-07-08, Gordon Matzigkeit:
* Bug fixes.
* Better configuration test to find the system linker.  The old test
  was failing because people frequently install GNU ld, but don't
  necessarily configure GCC to use it.
* Automake support for Libtool now uses the LTLIBRARIES primary.  See
  the Automake documentation for more information.
* Added new `--disable-static' flag to disable building static
  libraries on platforms that have shared libs.
* New `-allow-undefined' link flag to build shared libs that contain
  references to unresolved symbols.
* Removed all support for creating static-only libraries.
* Basic support for dynamically loaded modules: new `-export-dynamic'
  linking flag and corresponding `dlname' mode.
* New `--features' flag to display configured libtool attributes.
* Added support for installing libtool objects, both in absolute and
  relative directories.
* Support *-*-linux-gnu* as an alias for *-*-linux*.
* Support for *-*-openbsd* and *-*-freebsd3*.

New in 0.9 - 1997-02-03, Gordon Matzigkeit:
* Bug fixes.
* The libtool demo now uses the libm cos(3) function, to demonstrate
  inter-library dependencies.
* The PLATFORMS file has been moved to doc/platforms.texi.

New in 0.8 - 1997-01-26, Gordon Matzigkeit:
* Bug fixes, and more documentation.
* Basic support for other language compilers (C++, Fortran, and
  preprocessed assembler).
* Libtool is now more persistent when linking with the `-static'
  flag fails.
* New test for hardcoding system linkers, to verify that libtool
  neither creates incorrect binaries, nor takes unnecessary
  precautions while linking against uninstalled shared libraries.
* For clarity, the demo subdirectory no longer uses ansi2knr, and has
  been rewritten to avoid ANSI-only constructs.
* Support for *-*-irix5, *-*-irix6*, and *-*-sco3.2v5*.

New in 0.7 - 1996-12-08, Gordon Matzigkeit:
* Total rewrite of libtool, along with a new model for library building.
* Completely rewritten documentation for the new paradigm.
* Sane handling of broken system linkers, such as the ones on AIX
  and HP-UX.
* configure mode is now a separate program, `ltconfig'
* The libinfo helper script has been incorporated into the main
  libtool program.
* Automatic mode guessing, based on the command line.
* Full support for Automake 1.2 (including ansi2knr features).
* Support to create reloadable objects using link mode.
* Support for new `-static' linking flag.
* Support for stripping libraries during installation.
* Library version information is now passed on the command line, not
  through a version file.

Version 0.6 was never released.

New in 0.5:
* Disabled install-progs until next version, when it will be correctly
  implemented.
* Clearer library versioning documentation.  See (libtool)Versioning.
* Renamed gm_PROG_LIBTOOL to AM_PROG_LIBTOOL
* Libtool now creates pseudo-objects named foo.lo and pseudo-archives named
  libfoo.la instead of foo.o and libfoo.a.  See the documentation.
* libtool compile doesn't interfere with user CFLAGS if they don't
  conflict with the current objtype.  From Karl Berry.
* Created new libinfo helper script.
* libversion.in files are obsolete -- libtool uses libinfo to read the
  new LIBINFO files.
* Libtool is better at finding its config file and helper scripts.
* Support for *-*-gnu*

New in 0.4:
* Bug fixes and new regression tests
* On unsupported configurations, ``libtool configure'' demotes OBJTYPES to
  `standard' instead of aborting
* Added new object type, `t', for tcov(1) support
* Support for *-*-aix3*, *-*-aix4*, *-*-hpux10*, *-*-osf3*, and *-*-solaris2*

New in 0.3:
* Bug fixes and new regression tests
* Added new uninstall-libs mode
* Added a host argument to configure mode
* Fixed debugging/hyper-optimizing flags conflict (from Karl Berry)
* Support for --no-whole-archive when needed by GNU ld (from Ulrich Drepper)
* Implementation of --enable-linktype, --enable-profile, --enable-shared,
  --enable-static in gm_PROG_LIBTOOL macro
* New `libtoolize' program (modeled after GNU gettext's `gettextize') to help
  conversion to libtool
* New ABOUT-LIBS document for inclusion with libtool-supported packages

New in 0.2:
* Support for *-*-linux
* Better checking for GNU ld
* Reimplemented the config file so that it corresponds more closely to the
  variables listed in (libtool)Porting Libtool.
* Reimplemented the shared library version scheme.  See (libtool)Versioning.
* Replaced `--config-file' and `--version-file' options with `--confdir'
* Added new install-libs and install-progs modes

New in 0.1:
* First release of libtool
* Support for: *-*-freebsd*, *-*-netbsd*, *-*-sunos4*, *-*-ultrix4*
