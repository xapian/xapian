	* ltmain.in [darwin]: disable lazy linking, needed
	to resolve C++ global constructor issues

2002-12-30  Ralph Schleicher  <rs@nunatak.allgaeu.org>

	Rework by Robert Boehne <rboehne@gnu.org>
	* ltmain.in: New link option -shrext.
	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_CONFIG): New libtool variable shrext.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER): Replace all hard coded shared
	library file name extensions in library_names_spec and
	soname_spec with $shrext.
	* doc/libtool.texi (Link mode): Document it.

2002-12-30  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG): modify
	$archive_expsym_cmds to restore support for using
	.def files via the -export-symbols switch.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS([TAGNAME]): in both the [CXX]
	branch and the default branch, improve $export_symbols_cmds
	so that DATA symbols are properly  labelled.  In the default
	branch, duplicate the _CXX_CONFIG correction for
	$archive_expsym_cmds.

2002-12-30  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_RC): AC_PROG_RC doesn't exist --
	but we do AC_DEFUN something called LT_AC_PROG_RC.
	Call that instead.

2002-12-30  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG): Copy the section
	for Darwin from AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS so that the CXX
	tag doesn't use the g++ defaults for the OS X compiler.

2002-12-30  Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: Sync methods used to detect GNU ld.

2002-12-20  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_COMPILER_OPTION,
	AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_C_O): Do not escape } or ? in sed argument.

2002-12-19  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Use the sed program found by LT_AC_PROG_SED
	so that relink commands don't get truncated.

2002-12-18  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4: Move AC_REQUIRE([LT_AC_PROG_SED]) to AC_PROG_LD
	so it is invoked earlier.

2002-12-11  Allan Sandfeld Jensen  <snowwolf@one2one-networks.com>

	* libtool.m4: Add support for Intel icc compiler for Linux.

2002-12-11  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Revert the version +1 change for IRIX, it could
	cause compatibility problems.

2002-11-22  Christian Cornelssen  <ccorn@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_COMPILER_OPTION,
	AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_C_O): Changed method for compilation with
	custom flags to be language-independent.  Thereby removed
	CFLAGS/GCJFLAGS mixup bug.  Imitate Autoconf-style logging.
	Log entries no longer discarded by compilation failures.
	(_LT_AC_LANG_C_CONFIG, _LT_AC_LANG_CXX_CONFIG,
	_LT_AC_LANG_GCJ_CONFIG): Tuned settings of
	lt_simple_compile_test_code and lt_simple_link_test_code
	to avoid warnings that could break some option detections.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_COMPILER_NO_RTTI): Removed
	redundant "-c conftest.$ac_ext" in the argument to
	AC_LIBTOOL_COMPILER_OPTION.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): Replaced C-specific conftest
	source code with $lt_simple_compile_test_code, to support
	the "-lc" test with other languages.

2002-11-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't assume that egrep and fgrep exist.  POSIX 1003.1-2001 no
	longer requires them; you're supposed to use grep -E and grep -F
	instead.  Also, don't assume that "test -a" works, since POSIX
	doesn't require it.

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER, _LT_AC_LANG_C_CONFIG,
	_LT_AC_LANG_CXX_CONFIG, AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_GLOBAL_SYMBOL_PIPE,
	AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS):
	egrep -> grep, when that makes no difference.
	* libtoolize.in: Likewise.
	* ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_SYMBOL_USCORE): Likewise.
	* ltmain.in: Likewise.
	* demo/Makefile.am (hc-direct): Likewise.
	* pdemo/Makefile.am (hc-direct): Likewise.
	* tests/build-relink.test, tests/build-relink2.test,
	tests/cdemo-conf.test, tests/cdemo-shared.test,
	tests/cdemo-static.test, tests/demo-conf.test,
	tests/demo-nofast.test, tests/demo-shared.test,
	tests/demo-static.test, tests/depdemo-conf.test,
	tests/depdemo-nofast.test, tests/depdemo-shared.test,
	tests/depdemo-static.test, tests/hardcode.test,
	tests/mdemo-conf.test, tests/mdemo-shared.test,
	tests/mdemo-static.test, tests/pdemo-conf.test,
	tests/tagdemo-conf.test, tests/tagdemo-shared.test,
	tests/tagdemo-static.test: Likewise.

	* libtool.m4 (AC_PROG_EGREP):
	New macro, defined if Autoconf doesn't define.
	(AC_PATH_TOOL_PREFIX, AC_PROG_LD_GNU): Use it.
	(AC_PROG_LD, AC_PROG_NM, AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_GLOBAL_SYMBOL_PIPE):
	Use shell pattern matching rather than egrep.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_CONFIG): Set lt_EGREP and EGREP.

	* demo/Makefile.am (SET_HARDCODE_FLAGS): Use sed instead of egrep.
	* pdemo/Makefile.am (SET_HARDCODE_FLAGS): Likewise.

	* tests/defs (EGREP, FGREP): New vars.

	* ltmain.in: egrep -> $EGREP
	* tests/assign.test, tests/demo-exec.test, tests/demo-inst.test,
	tests/pdemo-exec.test, tests/pdemo-inst.test, tests/sh.test:
	Likewise.

	* tests/hardcode.test: fgrep -> $FGREP

	* tests/f77demo-exec.test: test -a -> test &&

2002-11-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* ltmain.in: When using gcc, pass -mfoo to the linker
	via $compiler_flags in order to pass architecture information to
	the linker (e.g. 32 vs 64-bit). This may also be accomplished via
	-Wl,-mfoo but this is not reliable with gcc because gcc may use
	-mfoo to select a different linker, different libraries, etc, while
	-Wl,-mfoo simply passes -mfoo to the linker. If there is a better
	solution, please let me know what it is.

2002-11-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Conditional assignment of FFLAGS = @FFLAGS@
	does not appear to be necessary given that Automake makes this
	assignment by default.  The condition is removed since Automake
	1.7.1 complains about it.

2002-11-18  Jakub Jelinek  <jakub@redhat.com>

	* libtool.m4: Support linking of 64-bit libraries on
	sparc{,v[789]}-*linux*, s390*-*linux*, ppc*-*linux*
	GNU/Linux systems when the platform default is to build
	32-bit libraries.

2002-11-18  Andreas Jaeger  <aj@suse.de>, Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* libtool.m4: Support linking of 32-bit libraries with ld
	on the x86-64, ppc64, s390x and sparc64 GNU/Linux systems.

2002-11-18  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* ltmain.in: Do not change the PATH in the wrappers: let them
	launch the real binary using its path.

2002-11-18  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* doc/libtool.texi (Library tips): Note array dimensions.

2002-11-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* tests/*.test: MinGW's MSYS treats files under /dev
	specially. This causes 'test -r /dev/null/config/site' to
	improperly report success, causing configure to fail. Change the
	CONFIG_SITE definition from "/dev/null/config/site" to
	"/nonexistent" to avoid this problem.

2002-11-18  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_LOCK): remove support for ancient
	versions of mingw and cygwin.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_POSTDEP_PREDEP): new function.
	moved the "find hidden library dependencies" code here
	from AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG.  Attempted to make it
	multi-tag compatible, but currently only CXX calls it.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG): set
	enable_shared_with_satic_runtimes to 'no' by default
	Set it to 'yes' for cygwin, mingw, pw32. Replace
	"find hidden library dependencies" code with a call
	to the new function AC_LIBTOOL_POSTDEP_PREDEP.
	Consolidate cygwin and mingw/pw32 stanzas.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_F77_CONFIG): set
	enable_shared_with_static_runtimes to 'no' by default
	(AC_LIBTOOL_CONFIG): add
	enable_shared_with_static_runtimes to the list of variables
	to write into ltmain.sh; include it in the libtool script
	template as allow_libtool_libs_with_static_runtimes.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): set
	enable_shared_with_static_runtimes to 'no' by default
	Set it to 'yes' for cygwin, mingw, pw32.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_GLOBAL_SYMBOL_PIPE): only put cr in regexp
	if the build_os is mingw, not host_os

	* ltmain.in (case deplibs_check_method): for all appropriate
	cases, if allow_libtool_libs_with_static_runtimes, then remove
	predeps and postdeps from the list of dependencies that must
	be checked for "dynamicness".  For the "none" case, the
	presence of compiler-generated postdeps and predeps should
	not trigger "inter-library dependencies not supported" error.
	(initial setup after arg processing): on cygwin/mingw, allow
	compiler-generated dependent libs to be duplicated without
	elimination.
	(initial search loop for deplibs): if the deplib in question
	is a libtool lib, then if
	allow_libtool_libs_with_static_runtimes then parse the .la file.
	If the .la file only has an "old_library", add the deplib
	directly to the deplibs list (-lstdc++) and DON'T use the .la
	file; this allows the (case deplibs_check_method) change above
	to take effect.
	* ltmain.in (for pass in $passes loop): remove predeps,
	postdeps, and compiler_lib_search_path from dependency_libs.

2002-11-08  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* doc/libtool.texi: Add --mode=* to every example using libtool.

2002-11-03  Ossama Othman  <ossama@doc.ece.uci.edu>

	* ltmain.in: add support for installing into temporary
	staging area (e.g. 'make install DESTDIR=...')

2002-11-03  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG): restore setting
	allow_undefined_flag=unsupported for cygwin and mingw.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): ditto, for both "normal" gcc/ld
	and for the (unmaintained?) MSVC case.

2002-11-03  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* doc/libtool.texi (Install mode): document new
	-inst-prefix option.

2002-11-02  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Print a warning if the mode is not specified.
	* doc/libtool.texi: Document the change that the mode must be
	specified.

2002-10-30  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_C_O): use printf, not
	echo. (AC_DEPLIBS_CHECK_METHOD): use new shell function
	win32_libid on w32 platforms
	* ltmain.in: add new section for shell functions. Add
	win32_libid() shell function.
	* f77demo/Makefile.am: add -no-undefined flag

2002-10-30  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* ltdl.c (realloc): Remove custom realloc. (#define
	rpl_realloc realloc) and comment out later code for custom
	realloc. You can't define your own malloc unless you know
	enough about the malloc in use to be able to tell how big
	the src ptr is. The disabled code incorrectly used the
	*destination* ptr to decide how much to copy. This
	sometimes results in out-of-bound accesses which cause
	segfaults. This is a quick hack for now; we may want
	something cleaner later.
	(tryall_dlopen_module): check to be sure (dirname_len > 0) before
	testing first character against '/'.
	(try_dlopen): check for feof(file) in read loop -- otherwise
	infinite loop?

2002-10-25  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in (-XCClinker): New flag passes a linking option
	directly to the compiler driver without appending ${wl}.

2002-10-25  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* README-alpha: Add some release note templates for inspiration
	and consistency at release time.

	* Makefile.am (cvs-diff): Compress the generated diff file, ready
	for upload to ftp.gnu.org.

2002-10-25  Howard Chu  <hyc@highlandsun.com>

	* ltmain.in [aix]: Be sure to deal with xlc_r, cc_r and other
	compiler variants.

2002-10-25  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_FILE_IMPGEN_C): Removed.  No longer used.
	(_LT_AC_FILE_LTDLL_C): Ditto.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_CONFIG) [cygwin, mingw, pw32, os2]: Don't call
	_LT_AC_FILE_LTDLL_C or _LT_AC_FILE_IMPGEN_C.

2002-10-25  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: When LDFLAGS="-Wl,-brtl,[other options]", the
	-brtl special-case code for AIX never gets triggered because
	were are being too specific about how we search for -brtl.
	Use case statement to avoid this. Remove extraneous
	semicolon.
	* ltmain.in: Recognize the IBM xlc compiler.

2002-10-24  Andrew Suffield  <asuffield@debian.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (lt_dlopenext): Corrected sense of "file not
	found" check.

2002-10-24  Ossama Othman  <ossama@doc.ece.uci.edu>

	* ltmain.in: Support compiler names matching g++*

2002-10-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* libtool.m4: Removed old Windows cruft.
	* libtool.m4: Adapted pw32 to be like Cygwin/MinGW.

2002-10-23  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	ltmain.in: Do not add 1 to the version under IRIX, it is
	not necessary.

2002-10-15  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_MAX_CMD_LEN): avoid long delay on
	 cygwin/Win9x when computing commandline length.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER): fix postinstall_cmds when
	sources are in a subdirectory
	* ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_SYSSEARCHPATH): use $PATH_SEPARATOR, not
	$ac_path_separator
	* configure.ac: move depdemo-specific stuff.  You must configure
	libtool before you can try './libtool --features'.
	* mdemo-inst.test: set $PATH to include the directory in which
	the modules are installed (on cygwin, DLL search path is the
	$PATH)

2002-10-15  Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* ltmain.in: MinGW works identically to Cygwin.
	* libtool.m4: lt_cv_sys_max_cmd_len hard-coded to 8192
	*  Model MinGW configuration after Cygwin configuration.
	Some portions share implementation.

2002-10-15  Elizabeth Barham <soggytrousers@yahoo.com>

	* libtool.m4: Pattern MinGW library naming after that
	used by Cygwin except use 'lib' prefix rather than 'cyg'.
	* Transfer some configuration from Cygwin with adjustments
	for MinGW.

2002-10-15  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: When a module is built for AIX, the 'lib'
	prefix isn't needed, neither is the version. AIX dlopen
	will honor the RPATH in a library.

2002-10-11  Christoph Egger  <Christoph_Egger@gmx.de>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS, darwin): Add
	-install_name to the link line only when -dynamiclib is
	specified for a module.  Use -bind_at_load when linking C++
	shared libraries.

2002-10-04  Elizabeth Barham  <soggytrousers@yahoo.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SETUP): GCC now checks -shared to
	create a dll for Windows targets.

2002-09-24  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Fixed a few spelling errors.

2002-09-17  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c: Commented out access() call that checks for a
	library file's existence and permissions, as it appears to fail
	in every case.

2002-09-09  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: Custom $symcode for Tru64 UNIX to catch 'Q',
	read-only constants.

2002-09-09  Rainer Orth  <ro@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.de>

	* libtool.m4 (osf[345]): Append $major to soname_spec.
	Reflect this in library_names_spec.
	* ltmain.in (osf): Prefix $major with '.' for use as extension.

2002-08-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* ltdl.m4 & libltdl/ltdl.c: Port fully to native Win32 API.

2002-07-31  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* f77demo/.cvsignore: New file, forgotten in the last commit.

2002-07-31  Eric Lindahl  <erik@theophys.kth.se>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_PROG_LIBTOOL): Added support for the new F77
	Fortran support tag.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_C_O, _LT_AC_TAGCONFIG): Support F77 tag.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_F77, _LT_AC_LANG_F77, AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_F77_CONFIG):
	New macros for F77 tag Fortran support.
	* configure.ac: Add support for creating the new F77 tag.
	* bootstrap: Add f77demo directory to the list to be processed.
	* Makefile.am: Add support for FFLAGS and FLIBS.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Add new Fortran tests.
	* tests/f77demo-*.test: New files.
	* f77demo/configure.ac, f77demo/cprogram.c, f77demo/fooc.c
	* f77demo/foof.f, f77demo/foo.h, f77demo/fprogram.f
	* f77demo/Makefile.am, f77demo/README: New files.

2002-07-16  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (tryall_dlopen): We need to catch missing file
	errors early so that file_not_found() can detect what happened.

2002-06-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfreisen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER) [mingw]: Remove
	extraneous '=' character which appears in gcc 3.1
	-print-search-dirs output.
	Handle both upper and lower case drive letters when testing for
	Windows vs POSIX style path output from -print-search-dirs
	output.

2002-06-24  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in (Piecewise linking): Add a clause to skip creating
	the export file until the reloadable object file(s) have been
	created, then use them as input for $export_symbols_cmds.

2002-06-23  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_SYS_DLOPEN_DEPLIBS): Need to quote [ and ] for
	Autoconf.

	* ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_SYS_DLOPEN_DEPLIBS): HP/UX needs
	libltdl_cv_sys_dlopen_deplibs set to yes.

2002-06-23  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SETUP, _LT_AC_LOCK): Use
	AC_PROVIDE_IFELSE to test AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL and
	AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN, necessary for autoconf 2.53.

2002-06-23  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (argz_insert): Actually, BEFORE can be NULL
	when *PARGZ_LEN is non-NULL, so the assertion to the contrary was
	bogus.
	Reported by Bob Friesenhahn <bfreisen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	and Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>

2002-06-21  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (foreach_dirinpath): Ensure that filename is '\0'
	terminated by all code paths.
	Reported by Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>

2002-06-20  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	From Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>:
	* doc/libtool.texi (Platform quirks): s/dependan/dependen/
	* libtool.m4 (AC_DEPLIBS_CHECK_METHOD): Ditto.
	* TODO: Ditto.

2002-06-13  Rainer Orth  <ro@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE>

	* ltmain.in (irix, nonstopux): Set major before use.

2002-06-11  Daniel Kobras  <kobras@linux.de>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (try_dlopen): Don't return bogus handle to user
	  if tryall_dlopen() fails.

2002-06-01  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* tests/pdemo-exec.test: Typo.  s/hell-static/hell_static/

2002-05-31  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* NEWS: Updated.
	* libtool.m4: use $NM to create the symbol list on cygwin, not
	$ltdll_cmds as on mingw.  For all tags, (and host=cygwin) set
	allow_undefined_flag="" so that the --auto-import magic
	works properly.  For all tags (and host=cygiwn) set
	always_export_symbols=no -- it is unnecessary thanks to
	binutils' auto-export magic.
	* libltdl/ltdl.c: Don't force cygwin to use the LoadLibrary
	wrapper; use cygwin's builtin implementatino of dl*.
	* cdemo/Makefile.am: the downside of unsetting
	'allow_undefined_flag' -- we must include -no-undefined
	in the _la_LDFLAGS variable.
	* depdemo/l1/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* depdemo/l2/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* depdemo/l3/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* depdemo/l4/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* mdemo/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* tagdemo/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* demo/Makefile.am: ditto.  But also, we must make special
	provision to clean up the hell0 wrapper script.
	* pdemo/Makefile.am: ditto -no-undefined.  ditto hell0.
	And use 'hell_static' instead of 'hell.static'.
	* tests/pdemo-inst.test: use 'hell_static' instead
	of 'hell.static'.
	* tests/pdemo-exec.test: ditto.

2002-05-30  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* tests/build-relink2.test: look for installed libl3.la
	in $prefix/lib/ as well as $prefix/lib/extra/.

2002-05-30  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* tests/hardcode.test: Use libtool --config to collect the
	variable values for the test, otherwise the tag values interfere
	with a straight grep.

2002-05-30  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	Finally fix the annoying bug which always adds all tags to the
	libtool script built by your project configure.  Now we set the
	default tags depending on whether AC_PROG_CXX et. al. are actually
	called from configure.ac.

	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_TAGCONFIG): Don't default the tagnames when
	no --with-tags argument is given.
	(_LT_AC_SHELL_INIT): Factored out from the AC_DIVERT_PUSH code
	in...
	(_LT_AC_PROG_ECHO_BACKSLASH): ...which now calls the macro
	instead.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_CXX): Use _LT_AC_SHELL_INIT to add CXX to the
	initialisation sequence for tagnames.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_GCJ): Similarly for GCJ tag.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_RC): Likewise for RC tag.

2002-05-21  Jon Meredith  <jonm@alchemetrics.co.uk>

	* ltmain.in: Fix a problem on SCO OpenServer5 that caused a
	failure in three depdemo-make tests. For some reason the linker
	tries to find the dependent libraries using the library search
	path before it has read the libraries specified with absolute
	paths in the full commandline. This patch add -L's for each of
	the dependent library directories so that they can be resolved.

2002-05-09  Nick Hudson  <skrll@netbsd.org>

	* libtool.m4: Update support for NetBSD
	* ltdl.m4: Make sure that libltdl_cv_func_dlopen and
	libltdl_cv_lib_dl_dlopen are set and used instead of the
	ac_cv_ versions. Also, use lt_cv_sys_global_symbol_pipe
	instread of global_symbol_pipe. This fixes the detection of
	dlopen on BSD derived plaforms and more importantly fixes
	need_uscore detection.

2002-05-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): head -1 -> sed 1q to
	port to POSIX 1003.1-2001 hosts, like textutils 2.0.21 with
	_POSIX2_VERSION=200112.

2002-05-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* ltmain.in: Don't assume that "sort +2" works, as POSIX
	1003.1-2001 says that "sort +2" is supposed to sort the file
	named "+2".  An example host that behaves like this is
	textutils 2.0.21 with _POSIX2_VERSION=200112.

2002-05-06  Loren James Rittle  <rittle@latour.rsch.comm.mot.com>

	* ltmain.in: Detect and handle object name conflicts while
	piecewise linking a static library.

2002-05-02  Dave Vasilevsky  <thevas@mac.com>

	* ltmain.in: Remove convenience libraries from deplibs for Darwin.

2002-05-02  Fritz Elfert  <felfert@to.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): Modify archive_expsym_cmds
	to catch properly handle dll alias symbols.

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_MAX_CMD_LEN): Use $build_os not $host_os.

2002-04-14  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* doc/libtool.texi (C++ libraries): Finally updated to reflect

	* libtool.m4: Update support for Fujistu-Siemens Computers (FSC).
	* ltmain.in: Add support for EBCDIC based systems.

2002-04-07  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (LT_AC_PROG_SED): Refactor, removing temporary directory
	and consistent use of the shell variable namespace "lt_ac_".

2002-04-02  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Finish the tag matching logic started yesterday and
	refactor it a bit.

2002-04-01  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Handle the case when no tag is explicitly set, and
	$base_compile has a space in front of $CC, and revert the setting
	of tagname checked in on 2002-3-14.

2002-04-01  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* tagdemo/foo.cpp: Use C++ IO to catch problems linking to C++
	runtime libraries.
	* tagdemo/main.cpp: Ditto.

2002-03-16  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* TODO: Removed obsolete comments about RMS' package system.

	ltmain.in: Touch-up to make testsuite pass, and default tagname
	to CC when it isn't explicitly set.

2002-03-14  Anthony Green  <green@redhat.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_C_O): Albert Chin's gcj fix.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_COMPILER_PIC): Per Bothner's change for not
	using -DPIC with gcj.

2002-03-11  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in(compile): bring a touch of order to the option processing
