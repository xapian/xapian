<h1>Installing Xapian</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document is intended to give a quick guide to how to install Xapian.
You can find more detailed instructions in the <code>INSTALL</code> file
which is in top level directory of each source tree.
</p>

<p>
Xapian can be built on UNIX systems (including MacOS X), and also Microsoft
Windows systems using GCC with mingw or cygwin, or MSVC.
</p>

<h2>Packaged binary versions</h2>

<p>
Pre-built Xapian packages are available for a number of platforms, including
most of the popular Linux distributions and BSD variants, and also Cygwin and
MSVC.  If you are using such a platform, you'll probably find it easiest to use
pre-built packages - it saves having to compile by hand and you'll generally
get updates automatically.
</p>

<p>
There are some links on our
<a href="http://xapian.org/download">download page</a> but it's likely
that Xapian packages are available for platforms we aren't aware of.  Feel
free to let us know and we'll add a link.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, the version packaged may be rather old, in which case you can
either request the packager to update, or build from source.  If you find we're
linking to a package which isn't being updated, please let us know so we can
remove the link.
</p>

<h2>Installing from Source</h2>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>
The first step is to obtain a copy of the software from the
<a href="http://xapian.org/download">Xapian download page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Unpacking</h3>

<p>
Use the usual tools to unpack the archives.  For example, on a Linux system:
</p>
<blockquote><code>
tar zxvf xapian-core-<i>&lt;versionnumber&gt;</i>.tar.gz<br>
tar zxvf xapian-omega-<i>&lt;versionnumber&gt;</i>.tar.gz
tar zxvf xapian-bindings-<i>&lt;versionnumber&gt;</i>.tar.gz
</code></blockquote>
<p>
These commands should unpack the archives into separate subdirectories
(<code>xapian-core-<i>&lt;versionnumber&gt;</i></code>,
<code>xapian-omega-<i>&lt;versionnumber&gt;</i></code> and
<code>xapian-bindings-<i>&lt;versionnumber&gt;</i></code> and
).
</p>

<h3>Configuring and building the Xapian library</h3>

<p>
For full details of the different options available when configuring and
building, read the file "INSTALL" in the top level directory of your newly
unpacked source tree.  But in many cases, the following quick summary is
all you need to know.
</p>

<p>
Building for MSVC is currently handled using a separately maintained set of
makefiles - you can find a link to these on the 
<a href="http://xapian.org/download">Xapian download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Each directory contains a <code>configure</code> script which checks various
features of your system.  Assuming this runs successfully, you can then run
<code>make</code> to build the software, and <code>make install</code> to
actually install it.  By default, the software installs under
<code>/usr/local</code>, but you can change this by passing
<code>--prefix=<i>/path/to/install</i></code> to <code>configure</code>.
So for example, you might use the following series of commands to build and
install xapian-core under <code>/opt</code>:
</p>

<blockquote><code>
cd xapian-core-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i><br>
./configure --prefix=/opt<br>
make<br>
sudo make install
</code></blockquote>

<p>
If you don't have root access to install Xapian, you can specify a prefix
in your home directory, for example:
</p>

<blockquote><code>
./configure --prefix=/home/jenny/xapian-install
</code></blockquote>

<h3>Configuring and building Omega</h3>

<p>
Omega can be built in almost exactly the same way as the core library.
Omega's <code>configure</code> script will try to locate your Xapian
installation by looking for the <code>xapian-config</code> script, which
is installed as <code><i>&lt;prefix&gt;</i>/bin/xapian-config</code>.
If <code><i>&lt;prefix&gt;</i>/bin/xapian-config</code> isn't on your
<code>PATH</code>, or you have multiple installations of Xapian (perhaps a
debug and non-debug build, or two different versions), you can specify
a <code>xapian-config</code> to use by passing <code>XAPIAN_CONFIG</code>
on the configure command line, as shown below:
</p>

<blockquote><code>
cd xapian-omega-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i><br>
./configure --prefix=/opt XAPIAN_CONFIG=/opt/bin/xapian-config<br>
make<br>
sudo make install
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Note that we use GNU libtool, which will set the runtime library search path if
your Xapian installation isn't in the dynamic linker search path, so there's
no need to mess around with setting <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
</p>

<h3>Configuring and building Xapian-bindings</h3>

<p>
Xapian-bindings is built much like Omega.  One thing to be aware of is that
by default we install the built bindings where they need to go to work without
further intervention, so they may get installed under <code>/usr</code> even
if the prefix is elsewhere.  See the <code>INSTALL</code> file for
xapian-bindings for details of how you can override this, and what steps
you'll need to take to run scripts which use the bindings if you do.
</p>
