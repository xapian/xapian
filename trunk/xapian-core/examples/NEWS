xapian-examples 0.8.5 (2004-12-23):

* INSTALL: Added non-generic installation instructions.

xapian-examples 0.8.4 (2004-12-08):

* Updated to use the new Database/WritableDatabase constructors rather than
  the Xapian::Auto::open() factory functions.

* configure: Removed unused code which probes for stlport.  We need to use
  stlport for everything or nothing anyway.

* Updated to use the reworked GNU getopt from xapian-core.

* Compile everything as C++.

xapian-examples 0.8.3 (2004-09-20):

* createdatabase: Removed this example - it's rather pointless now that Quartz
  creates the containing directory if required.
	  
* configure: Fixed to actually pass GCC warning flags through to the makefile.

xapian-examples 0.8.2 (2004-09-13):

* delve: Report name of database in the "failed to open" message.

xapian-examples 0.8.1 (2004-06-30):

* copydatabase: Make use of new get_lastdocid() method.

* copydatabase: Output an extra space after the progress report so that we
  don't get "... docs to goooo"!

xapian-examples 0.8.0 (2004-04-19):

* delve: `delve -v DATABASE' now reports the number of terms.

* Added or improved the short description of each example at the top of
  its source file.

* Replaced the rather peculiar msearch with quest - a simpler command line
  search program which uses Xapian::QueryParser.

* simpleindex: We were ignoring the last paragraph if it had no trailing \n
  - fixed (bug#24).
