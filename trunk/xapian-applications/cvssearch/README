CVSSearch
=========

===========================================================================
INSTALLATION
============

If you're using Debian testing or unstable you should be able to install all
the required dependencies apart from Xapian using:

apt-get install exuberant-ctags libdb4.0++-dev libxml2-dev

* install ctags 5.0 or higher (warning: version 4.x won't work) from
  http://ctags.sourceforge.net

  Make sure this version of ctags is in your path *and* is executed
  by default

* install a suitable release of the sleepycat database from
  http://www.sleepycat.com/download/index.shtml

  The cvssearch source should build with either 4.0.x or 4.1.x.  4.2.x hasn't
  been released at the time of writing.  Older versions have not been tested.

  From the dist/ directory, type

  ./configure --enable-cxx [see Note 1 below]
  make
  make install

* download Xapian 0.8.0 or higher from
  http://www.xapian.org/download.php

  From the main directory, type

  ./configure [configure options]
  make
  make install

* install the latest version of libxml from
  ftp://xmlsoft.org/

  From the main directory, type

  ./configure [see Note 1 below]
  make
  make install

* now configure CVSSearch, compile, and install:

  ./configure --bindir=<your cgi-bin directory> [see Note 2 below]
  make
  make install

Note 1:
* If you do not have root access, then sleepycat, Xapian, libxml cannot be
  installed under their default output directory: /usr/local.

* One solution is to install these two packages in the user home directory
  by append "--prefix=$HOME" to the configure commands (not for CVSSearch)
  and set the following environment variable before compiling CVSSearch

* for csh:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$HOME/lib"
  setenv LDFLAGS "-L$HOME/lib -O3 -Wall"
  setenv CXXFLAGS "-I$HOME/include -O3 -Wall"
  setenv CFLAGS "-I$HOME/include -O3 -Wall"
  setenv CPPFLAGS "-I$HOME/include -O3 -Wall"

  or

* for bash:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/lib"
  export LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/lib -O3 -Wall"
  export CXXFLAGS="-I$HOME/include -O3 -Wall"
  export CFLAGS="-I$HOME/include -O3 -Wall"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/include -O3 -Wall"

Note 2:
* there is no need to specify --prefix because we want to output
  all the executables, scripts to a directory with cgi access.


===========================================================================
Building a CVSSearch Database
=============================
You can index modules (may also be called packages) from a repository by

1. cd <cgi-bin directory>

   [ this cgi-bin directory contains all the scripts/executables. this is
     necessary because the command building the database uses other
     programs/scripts that it assumes to be in the same directory as
     cvsbuilddb ]

2. Export CVSDATA environment variable to the path to CVSSearch databases.

   [ this path may be an absolute path or a path relative to the
     cgi-bin directory in step 1. ]

   e.g. say CVSSearch database output is to be stored under a directory
        called cvsdata relative to the cgi-bin directory containing the
        executables. ie CVSSearch databases are stored under
        <cgi-bin directory>/cvsdata, do

   for csh:
   setenv CVSDATA cvsdata

   for bash:
   export CVSDATA=cvsdata

3. Export CVSROOT environment variable to the path to CVS repository.
   [ this step is usually already done. type "echo $CVSROOT" to find out]

   for csh:
   setenv CVSROOT ROOT [ROOT = path of CVS repository]

   for bash:
   export CVSROOT=ROOT [ROOT = path of CVS repository]


4. Build the database type

   ./cvsbuilddb -f module.list

   [ module.list is file containing a list of modules [See Note 3 below]
     in CVS repository to index. ./ before cvsbuilddb is necessary because
     the cgi-bin directory is usually not in the path ]

         or

   ./cvsbuilddb module1 module2 ...

   [ module1 module2 are modules [See Note 3 below] in CVS repository to
     index]

Note 3:
a module is something that you can "cvs checkout".. this can be

* a single dot "." to index the entire repository

  [ this is NOT recommended as a single database will be created for that
    and files produced are likely to be very large ]


* a single directory e.g. "kdebase" to index all modules
  below kdebase directory

  [ this is ok, but not desirable if it is a large repository because
    again a single database will be created for that.]


* a multi-level directory e.g. "kdebase/konqueror" to index the module
  kdebase/konqueror

  [ this is recommended. konqueror is a stand-alone package ]

you can always add additional modules at a later time.



===========================================================================
Building Multiple Databases for Multiple CVS Repositories
=========================================================

CVSSearch supports multiple CVS repositories so a single query can search
from multiple repositories.

[See Directory Structure section on how this is done]

If you have already indexed modules from one repository and want to index
other repositories then

1. Perform step 1 and 2 from the previous section.

   [multiple repositories can use the same database path, so no need to
    use different CVSDATA setting for different repositories]

2. ./cvsbuilddb -d ANOTHER_CVSROOT -f module.list
       or
   ./cvsbuilddb -d ANOTHER_CVSROOT module1 module2 ...

   [-d ANOTHER_CVSROOT is used to overide the current $CVSROOT
    environment variable or if $CVSROOT is not set, this can be an
    anonymous CVS server but not a secured CVS server.]


===========================================================================
Searching a CVSSearch Database
==============================

To search the database, use the URL
   http://<Your Domain Name>/<your cgi-bin dir>/Query.cgi

To see how code alignment works, use the URL
   http://<Your Domain Name>/<your cgi-bin dir>/Compare.cgi


Security & File Permissions
===========================

* the user to build the database must have read and write access to the
  repository. A cache directory with mode 775 is created to store temporary
  files during query time. [ this directory may be cleaned from time to time ]

* the user the server uses to run the cgi-script must have read/execute access
  to the scripts/executables, and read access to the configuration file found
  under cgi-bin directory: cvssearch.conf

* to use Compare.cgi, the user the server uses to run the cgi-script
  must have read/write access to the repository.

* to use Query.cgi, There will be a cache directory created under your
  cgi-bin directory that has mode 775.


Directory structure
===================

This section describes the directory format for $CVSDATA, the directory
where all the databases/statistic information goes under.

The directory structure:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

                   $CVSDATA
   +-------------------+------------------------------+----------...
CVSROOTS              root1                         root2        ...
            +-----------+------------+            +---+---+
           db          src       dbcontent        db  src dbcontent
        +-----...       +----...                  +   +   +

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CVSROOTS is a file, that maps each CVSROOT to a directory where the
database for that CVSROOT is stored, so it looks something like this:

  /home/.../cvsroot        root0
  /home/.../another_root   root1
  ...


this means information for /home/.../cvsroot repository is
stored under root0, etc...

Under each rootx directory, we have
db directory:

   contains Xapian and sleepycat database files for each projects.
   so it looks something like this:
   (suppose dir1/prject1 dir2/project2 are indexed):
   db/
       dir1_project1.db       contains berkeley databases
       dir1_project1.cmt      contains line-comment mappings
       dir1_project1.om       contains a Xapian database
(not currently built:
       dir1_project1.om2      contains another Xapian database)
       dir1_project1.offset   contains in the format
                             [ file_path index <into the cmt file>^B]
       dir1_project1.st       contains statistics for dir/project1

       dir2_project2.db
       dir2_project2.cmt
       ...

src directory:

   contains the checked out source files for this CVSROOT.
   so it looks something like this:
   src/
       dir/
           project1/
               file1.cc
               file2.cc
           project2/
               file3.cc
               ...

dbcontent file:

   contains all the module names built under this root, with
   every slash '/' changed to a '_', so it looks something like this:

   dir_project1
   dir_project2
   ...

FAQ
===

Q) What do I do if I need to move my CVS repository?
A) Modify the file $CVSDATA/CVSROOTS and change the old CVSROOT value to the new CVSROOT value

Q) What do I do if the cgi script shows an error?
A) Permission is usually the culprit.

   Check the following:
   1. the user id that runs the cgi-script from your local web adminstrator.
   2. check Security & File Permissions.

   [ a package called cgi-wrap may be used to execute the script with the
    user id of the scripts/executables ]

Q) What happens if you run cvsbuilddb twice on the same input? Does it work
properly?  Does it erase all existing databases before recreating them?
A) It still works properly. Yes, it erases all existing databases
before recreating them.

Q) In that case, is the contentdb file updated properly?  Or does it contain
duplicate entries?  Does it matter if it does?
A) Yes it is updated properly (in the above case): contentdb file contains
no duplicate entries.
(Note: If it does contain duplicate entries, the same database will be
searched multiple times)
