     *          queries in the training file. This file should be in standard format specified.
     *  @param  msetsize   This is the mset size used for the first retrieval for training queries. It should be selected depending on the qrel file
     *          and database size.
     *  @param  filename   Filename path where the training file has to be stored. Default is "./training-data.txt".
     *  @param  flist      Xapian::FeatureList object definining what set of features to use for preparing the training file.
     *          It is initialised by DEFAULT set of Features by default.
     *          To use a custom set of features, pass a customised Xapian::FeatureList object.
