This paragraph talks about lions and tigers and bears (oh, my!).  It mentions
giraffes, but that's not really very important.  Lions and tigers are big
cats, so they must be really cuddly.  Bears are famous for being cuddly, at
least when they're teddy bears.

This paragraph talks about giraffe unicycles, and doesn't have much to do
with animals at all.  It's all about jugglers, the circus, and people on
really daft modes of transportation.  Giraffes are particularly daft, and
can be over eight feet tall.

This is the paragraph of interest.  Tigers are massive beasts - I wouldn't
want to meet a hungry one anywhere.  Lions are scary even when lyin' down.
Bears are scary even when bare.  Together I suspect they'd be less scary,
as the tigers, lions, and bears would all keep each other busy.  On the
other hand, bears don't live in the same continent as far as I know.
