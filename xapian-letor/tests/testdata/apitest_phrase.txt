This is a test document for the PHRASE and NEAR operators.  And what a
wonderful pair of operators they are.

The PHRASE operator is ordered; the NEAR operator just looks from the
specified terms in any order.

You can specify a window size.  This allows the operators to be used for
finding near phrases or a group of words close to each other.
