Welcome to Xapian's Learning to Rank Framework
==============================================

Xapian's build system is built using GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool.
If you've installed other Open Source projects from source, you should
find yourself in familiar territory.  Building and installing involves
the following 3 simple steps:

 1) Run "./bootstrap xapian-core xapian-letor" in the top level directory.
    Note: It is preferred that you bootstrap all of the xapian project together.
    To do that, run:
    "./bootstrap xapian-core xapian-applications/omega swig xapian-bindings xapian-letor"
 2) Run "./configure", possibly with some extra arguments
 3) Run "make" to build
 4) Run "make install" to install

Prerequisites
=============

You'll need to install the following prerequisites before you can
build xapian-letor:

 * xapian-core: We recommend using matching versions of xapian-core and
   xapian-letor.  If you install xapian-core from a package, make sure you
   also install the development files which are often packaged separately
   (e.g. in libxapian-dev or xapian-core-devel).

 * libsvm (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/): We developed
   xapian-letor using libsvm version 3.1, but we've also tested with 3.0
   and that seems to work fine too.

   If you install libsvm from a package system, make sure you have the
   headers and other files needed to actually build code that uses libsvm
   (not just the runtime libraries) - if you have /usr/include/libsvm/svm.h
   then you are probably good.  Often these files are in a separate
   package, which is probably named something like libsvm-dev or
   libsvm-devel.

   On Mac OS X, if you installed libsvm using homebrew but got the following
   error when running the configure script:

      configure: error: libsvm required but libsvm/svm.h not found

   Suppose you are using libsvm 3.21, you can type the following into terminal
   and rerun the configure script:

      ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/libsvm/3.21/include/ /usr/local/include/libsvm
