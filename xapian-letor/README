Welcome to Xapian's Learning to Rank Framework
==============================================

Building & installing involves the following three steps:
(*Make sure you are in the top-level directory*)

1) Run "./letor-bootstrap"
2) Run "./letor-configure", possibly with some extra arguments
3) Run "make -f Makefile.letor"
4) Run "make install -f Makefile.letor"

*Note*: While configuring xapian-letor, make sure that backend build flags
are same as those used while configuring xapian-core.

Prerequisites
=============

You'll need to install the following prerequisites before you can
build xapian-letor:

 * xapian-core: We recommend using matching versions of xapian-core and
   xapian-letor.  If you install xapian-core from a package, make sure you
   also install the development files which are often packaged separately
   (e.g. in libxapian-dev or xapian-core-devel).

 * libsvm (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/): We developed
   xapian-letor using libsvm version 3.1, but we've also tested with 3.0
   and that seems to work fine too.

   If you install libsvm from a package system, make sure you have the
   headers and other files needed to actually build code that uses libsvm
   (not just the runtime libraries) - if you have /usr/include/libsvm/svm.h
   then you are probably good.  Often these files are in a separate
   package, which is probably named something like libsvm-dev or
   libsvm-devel.

   On Mac OS X, if you installed libsvm using homebrew but got the following
   error when running the configure script:

      configure: error: libsvm required but libsvm/svm.h not found

   Suppose you are using libsvm 3.21, you can type the following into terminal
   and rerun the configure script:

      ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/libsvm/3.21/include/ /usr/local/include/libsvm
