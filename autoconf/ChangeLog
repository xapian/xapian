	Fix regression in handling VAR=VALUE arguments to testsuite.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT) <PARSE_ARGS_END>: Detect
	leading = as invalid.  Defer use of command-line variable
	assignments...
	<PREPARE_TESTS>: ...here, after atconfig has been sourced.  Fix
	regression in sourcing files.
	* tests/autotest.at (Using atlocal): New test to catch this.
	(Debugging a successful test, Choosing where testsuite is run):
	Use correct shell.
	Reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

	Document grep peculiarity.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools) <grep>: Document
	BSD behavior on binary input.

	Minor testsuite improvements.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT) <PREPARE_TESTS>: Use fewer
	forks when sanitizing PATH.  Always output machine information,
	not just when atconfig was located.

	Add 'testsuite -C dir'.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (_AT_ARG_OPTION): Move missing argument
	detection...
	(AT_INIT) <PARSE_ARGS_END>: ...here, since -k always takes
	argument.
	<DEFAULTS>: Delay computation of variables based on $at_dir...
	<PREPARE_TESTS>: ...to here, since -C can change $at_dir.
	<TESTS>: Re-invoke via absolute name, since -C may be in effect.
	<PARSE_ARGS>: Parse new option.
	<HELP_TUNING>: Document it.
	* tests/autotest.at (Choosing where testsuite is run): New test
	for this feature.
	(Keywords and ranges): Add test for missing -k argument.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (testsuite Invocation): Likewise.

2008-01-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* build-aux/config.guess, build-aux/config.sub,
	build-aux/texinfo.tex: Sync from gnulib.
	* doc/fdl.texi, doc/make-stds.texi, doc/standards.texi:
	Likewise.

2008-01-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs): Do not mention the
	Autoconf version in which the AC_PROG_INSTALL change was done.
	Suggested by Paul Eggert.

2008-01-22  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix --help=recursive with multiple AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_HELP): If, for recursive help
	mode, we change to the source directory, also set $ac_pwd so we
	do not go back to the build tree for the next config subdir.
	* tests/torture.at (Deep Package): Extend test to contain two
	config subdirs on the top level.

	Fix parallel `maintainer-check'.
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check-tests): Depend on `all'.
	Use `$(MAKE) $(AM_MAKEFLAGS)' instead of plain `make'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (maintainer-check-c++, maintainer-check-posix):
	Likewise.
	(maintainer-check): Serialize the testsuite runs.

2008-01-08  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/Makefile.am (noinst_SCRIPTS): Renamed from
	check_SCRIPTS.  Building the wrappers for `all' allows help2man
	to use them for the manpages.
	Report by Benoit Sigoure.

	* bin/autoreconf.in: Discard stderr for $autoconf/$aclocal --help.

2007-12-16  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix some write failure cases in Autotest.

	(m4_require): Avoid extra macro calls.

2007-12-08  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/torture.at (srcdir): Fix quoting.

	Do not pass top_srcdir to configure scripts in testsuite.
	* tests/autotest.at (srcdir propagation): Copy install-sh to
	source tree.
	(my only test): Drop setting of `top_srcdir'.
	* tests/base.at (Input/Output): Likewise.
	* tests/local.at (AT_CONFIGURE_AC): Copy install-sh,
	config.guess, and config.sub to test source tree.
	Drop AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR setting.
	(AT_CHECK_CONFIGURE): Drop setting of `top_srcdir'.
	* tests/torture.at (Substitute a 2000-byte string): Drop
	AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR setting, copy install-sh to test source tree.
	(Substitute a newline, datarootdir workaround): Likewise.
	(Define a newline): Adjust for linenumber changes in configure.ac.
	* tests/foreign.at (Libtool): Adjust comment to reflect changes.

	* tests/semantics.at (AC_PATH_PROGS_FEATURE_CHECK): Skip test
	if `pwd` contains whitespace.

	Quote $abs_top_srcdir in tests.
	* tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_PERL_SYNTAX): Likewise.
	* tests/tools.at (Syntax of the shell scripts): Likewise.

	* tests/m4sh.at (LINENO): Quote $0.

	Fix testsuite program wrapper for whitespace in `pwd`.
	The problem here is that the usual mantra is that command
	variables can contain arguments, thus we cannot just escape
	$AUTOCONF, $AUTOM4TE etc.  The compromise is to put the
	$top_builddir/tests directory early in $PATH, so that the
	wrappers are found by their plain name.
	* tests/wrapper.as: Put $testdir early in $PATH.
	(AUTOCONF, AUTOHEADER, AUTOM4TE): Set to plain command names.

	Proper config.status --file/--header and $srcdir escaping.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP): Quote special
	characters in $ac_file_inputs.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_FILE, _AC_OUTPUT_HEADER): eval $ac_file_inputs
	accordingly.
	* tests/torture.at (datarootdir workaround): Adjust.
	(AC_CONFIG_FILES, HEADERS, LINKS and COMMANDS): Extend test.

	Fix Autotest for whitespace in `pwd`.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT)
	<at_func_create_debugging_script, Driver Loop>:
	Quote $at_group_dir.
	* tests/autotest.at (whitespace in absolute testdir): New test.

	* lib/autom4te.in: Quote @datadir@.

	Proper file name escaping in Autoconf programs and Perl modules.
	This includes escaping of characters special to the shell
	as well as special to Perl, e.g., leading `<' or `>'.
	For example, when $file starts with `>', `open ">$file"'
	wrongly tries to append to a different file.
	* bin/autoconf.as: Fix quoting for autom4te options.
	* lib/Autom4te/General.pm (shell_quote): New function, taken
	from coreutils, written by Jim Meyering.
	(mktmpdir): Use it.
	* bin/autom4te.in (files_to_options, handle_m4): Use shell_quote
	and open_quote.
	* bin/autoreconf.in (parse_args): Likewise.
	* bin/autoscan.in (main): Likewise.
	* bin/autoupdate.in (main): Likewise.
	* bin/autoheader.in: Likewise, fixing old insufficient escaping.
	* bin/ifnames.in: Likewise, XFile usage fixes.
	* tests/tools.at (autom4te and whitespace in file names): Extend
	test.  Test twice, with special characters allowed on w32, and the
	rest.  Test leading and trailing whitespace, for `open_quote'.
	(autotools and whitespace in file names): New, analogous test.
	Reported by Paul Eggert and Benoit Sigoure, additional suggestions
	by Russ Allbery and Eric Blake.

	Sync from Automake.
	* lib/Autom4te/Channels.pm, lib/Autom4te/Configure_ac.pm,
	lib/Autom4te/Struct.pm, lib/Autom4te/XFile.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Autom4te/FileUtils.pm (open_quote): New function.
	(update_file, contents): Use it.

	* Makefile.am (autom4te-update): Rewrite for git.

2007-12-04  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (autom4te Invocation, Autom4te Cache): Fix typos.

	Fix copyright years.
	* Makefile.am, doc/install.texi, lib/autoconf/fortran.m4,
	lib/autoconf/lang.m4, lib/freeze.mk: Likewise.

2007-12-04  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	Manually resync with gnulib, since 'make cvs-update' no longer works.
	* build-aux/config.guess: New upstream version.
	* build-aux/config.sub: Likewise.

	When using older automake, don't downgrade build-aux/texinfo.tex.
	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Add no-texinfo.tex option.
	* doc/Makefile.am (TEXINFO_TEX): Add.

2007-11-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix AC_C_BIGENDIAN bug caused by new awk method of substitution.
	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_BIGENDIAN): Don't comment out the
	#undef as this runs afoul of our new way of creating config.h.
	Problem reported by Jim Meyering in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2007-11/msg00164.html>.

2007-11-26  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix autom4te for unusual characters in input file names.
	* bin/autom4te.in (files_to_options): Quote active characters
	for the shell.
	* tests/tools.at (autom4te and white space in file names):
	New test.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools) <awk>:
	Document that Tru64 awk always splits $0.

2007-11-24  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Do not extract the
	`#AT_STOP_...' line at the end of each test.

2007-11-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): For awk line number
	extraction script, ensure `$at_group' has a defined value
	even for the empty set, and properly quote its usage inside
	the awk script.

2007-11-22  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Shell Functions): New chapter.  Document
	IRIX sh $0 issue in functions, move content from ...
	(Portable Shell): ... here.
	(Shell Script Compiler): Note that shell functions are not
	totally unportable any more.

2007-11-22  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Exit awk script after
	extracting the line numbers of the last needed test.

2007-11-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT) <at_func_create_debugging_script>:
	Fix quoting.

2007-11-19  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix IRIX testsuite debugging failures: $0 in functions.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT) <at_func_create_debugging_script>:
	Do not use $0 inside a function, as IRIX sh will set that to the
	function name rather than the script invocation name.

2007-11-19  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (at_func_test): Use cached line numbers
	to extract test scripts.
	(AT_INIT): Extract and cache test script line numbers.

2007-11-19  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4: Revert 2007-11-15 patch and
	subsequent fixups; the awk -> here-document conversion trashes
	performance too much with AIX sh.

2007-11-18  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/local.at: Do not test m4, perl with AT_TESTED.

	Diagnose and guard against write errors dealing with config.status.
	The general idea is this: all write failures from `configure'
	writing `config.status' are indicated by $ac_write_error, which
	is only checked at the end.  This is safe because config.status
	code is not executed before the file is complete.  Other write
	failures, be they inside config.status, or in sub shell/awk
	scripts spawned from configure or config.status, typically need
	earlier checking, as their results are used right afterwards.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (AC_OUTPUT): Initialize `ac_write_fail'
	before writing config.status, check afterwards.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE, _AC_OUTPUT_FILE)
	(_AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS_PREPARE,_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS):
	Set `ac_write_error' for write failures to config.status.  Barf
	upon write failures to temporary files.
	Adjust note about closing and reopening the here-document.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_HEADER, _AC_OUTPUT_LINK, _AC_OUTPUT_COMMAND)
	(_AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP): Likewise, adjust note about closing and
	reopening the here-document.
	* tests/torture.at (AC_CONFIG_FILES, HEADERS, LINKS and COMMANDS):
	Ensure `ac_write_error' does not escape into config.status.
	Also, add a couple of code paths not yet exercised in the test
	suite: a config file with input from stdin, and a config header
	output to stdout.
	Suggestion for catching write errors by Bruno Haible.

2007-11-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid error with Tru64 awk and testsuite lines with many words.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): In the awk script that
	reads the testsuite, set the field separator to an unusual value,
	in order to not run over the limit of 199 fields.  Tru64 4.0D awk
	even splits the input if $i, i>0, was never accessed in the script.

	Revert 2007-10-17 change.
	* TODO: Multiline args in config files and headers mean something
	different and are not fixed, see
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2007-05/msg00017.html>
	Report by Stepan Kasal.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Generic Programs): Fix typo.

2007-11-16  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	AC_*_TOOL does not canonicalize the prefix
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Generic Programs): Do not say that
	the *_TOOL macros canonicalize, they simply use the `host_alias'.

2007-11-16  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Diagnose write errors in config.status instantiations.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE)
	(_AC_OUTPUT_HEADER, _AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP): Bail out
	on write errors.
	* tests/torture.at (AC_CONFIG_FILES, HEADERS, LINKS and COMMANDS):
	Extend test to also check for some write error failures, using...
	<AT_CHECK_CONFIG_CREATION_NOWRITE>: ...this new macro.
	Report by Bruno Haible.

	Indentation fixups.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT) <at_func_log_failure>: Fix
	indentation.
	(_AT_CHECK): Use less indentation, to save space.

2007-11-15  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Add witness macro for @top_build_prefix@ substitution.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_HAVE_TOP_BUILD_PREFIX): New macro.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): Mention it here.

2007-11-15  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (at_func_test): Remove.
	(AT_INIT): Pre-extract test groups into separate files.
	(AT_CLEANUP): Source pre-extracted file instead of calling at_func_test.
	Remove at-test-source files together with the $at_group_dir.
	* tests/autotest.at (Long test source lines): New test.

2007-11-15  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Shell functions and variables may share a namespace.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Portable Shell): Mention Solaris sh
	limitation.

2007-11-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (_AC_TYPE_LONG_LONG_SNIPPET): Make comment match

2007-11-14  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4: Fix a couple of comment typos.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_TMPDIR): Use $as_me, not $me.

2007-11-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Clean up the rule to create "expr".
	* tests/Makefile.am (expr): Don't redirect directly to target.
	Redirect just once, not for each echo statement.
	Use $@, not literal "expr".

2007-11-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Don't worry about preprocessor when testing long long.
	See: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2007-11/msg00075.html
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Preprocessor Arithmetic): New section.
	(AC_TYPE_LONG_LONG_INT, AC_TYPE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_INT):
	These no longer check for preprocessor flaws.
	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (_AC_TYPE_LONG_LONG_SNIPPET):
	Do not check for preprocessor flaws.

2007-11-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Adapt dependencies, now that a version change doesn't modify configure.ac
	* GNUmakefile: Remove "make clean" kludge.
	* lib/m4sugar/Makefile.am (version.m4): Depend on Makefile, not
	configure.ac.
	Don't redirect directly to target.
	Use $@, not literal "version.m4".

2007-11-12  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Making testsuite Scripts): Document
	":;{" shorthand as in previous patch.

2007-11-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Builtins): Document problem
	with { ... } a bit more clearly.  Suggest ":;{" as a shorthand
	for the workaround.
	* lib/m4sugar/Makefile.am (version.m4): Detect 'echo' failure.
	Use ":;{" shorthand.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/package.m4): Likewise.

2007-11-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Add more non-srcdir build support.
	* GNUmakefile (dummy): Split a long line.
	Add -v option to autoreconf invocation.

	Remove the autoreconf-provided INSTALL, so that we regenerate it.
	* GNUmakefile (dummy): Remove INSTALL.

	Remove racy commands to build scripts in bin/ and tests/.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Now that scripts in bin/ and tests/
	are guaranteed to be built, remove the rules that tried to build
	them.  Before, with a parallel build, these rules could lead to
	two processes writing tests/wrapper.in concurrently.

	Build in man/ only *after* building in bin/ and tests/.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): The man-page-creation process runs $(MAKE)
	in both bin/ and tests/.

	Accommodate non-srcdir build-from-checkout.
	* build-aux/git-version-gen: Require an additional parameter: $srcdir.
	Use git's --git-dir=$srcdir/.git option.
	Add quotes, in case tarball_version_file contains shell meta-characters.
	* GNUmakefile (_curr-ver): Pass $(srcdir) to git-version-gen.
	* configure.ac: Pass "." to git-version-gen.

	Avoid spurious test failures due to version skew.
	* GNUmakefile (dummy): Run $(MAKE) clean after autoreconf -i.

2007-11-12  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid warnings about conftest.dSYM directories on Mac OS X Leopard.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_LINK_IFELSE, _AC_RUN_IFELSE):
	Remove conftest.dSYM directory.
	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC_V_OUTPUT)
	(_AC_LANG_PROGRAM_C_, _AC_FC_MAIN, __AC_FC_NAME_MANGLING):
	Remove `conftest.*' recursively.
	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (AC_LINK_IFELSE): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/specific.m4 (_AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_MACRO_VALUE):
	Likewise.
	(_AC_COMPILER_OBJEXT_REJECT): Reject *.dSYM.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report and analysis by Jeff Squyres and Peter O'Gorman.

2007-11-12  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Fix typos in variable names.
	* tests/semantics.at (test for AC_CHECK_LIB): s/at_m/ac_m/.

2007-11-11  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Document that $((expression)) is not portable.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Shell Substitutions): Here.

2007-11-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Ignore configure --help* errors due to LINENO-impaired shells.
	* tests/torture.at (Configuring subdirectories, Deep Package):
	In the --help* tests in read-only trees, make `.' temporarily
	writable again for the `stderr' file, and ignore errors due to
	the attempt to write configure.lineno.
	Report by Patrick Welche.

2007-11-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Generate package.m4 in build-dir, not srcdir.
	* tests/Makefile.am (package.m4): Adjust target.
	Don't redirect directly to $@.
	(CLEANFILES): Add package.m4.
	($(TESTSUITE)): Depend on just-built package.m4, not the one
	in $(srcdir).
	When running $(AUTOTEST), search "." before searching $(srcdir).

	Avoid a race condition that would make parallel "distclean" fail.
	* tests/Makefile.am (distclean-generic): Replace the default,
	automake-provided rule with an identical one, but with an additional
	dependency on distclean-local.  Simply adding the dependency would
	cause automake not to emit the rule at all.
	* BUGS: Building with -jN works, now.

	Distribute git-version-gen.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add build-aux/git-version-gen,
	since GNUmakefile is distributed, and requires it for dist* rules.

	Remove two more generated files from version control.
	* INSTALL: Remove generated file.
	* lib/autoscan/autoscan.list: Remove generated file.

2007-11-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* GNUmakefile (PATH): Remove stray apostrophes; they become
	part of PATH, which isn't wanted here.

2007-11-09  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	New config files output variable `top_build_prefix'.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): Substitute
	`top_build_prefix'.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Preset Output Variables): Document it.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Bob Friesenhahn.

	Avoid expr for arithmetic evaluation if the shell accepts $((...)).
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT) <at_func_arith>: New
	function, to parametrize arithmetic with expr vs. the shell.
	Use it where possible.
	Suggestion by Benoit Sigoure.

2007-11-03  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Adjust the documentation of autotest WRT atlocal.

	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (_AC_CHECK_TYPE_NEW):
	For C, just try sizeof (TYPE) and sizeof ((TYPE)); if the former

	This lets people use function types and so forth.
	For C++ there doesn't seem to be a simple solution, so leave it alone.

	separate items of `ac_user_opts', to avoid long lines.
	(_AC_INIT_PARSE_ENABLE2, _AC_ENABLE_IF_ACTION): Adjust.

2007-01-08  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Fix some typos.

2007-01-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix some wording problems noted by Paolo Bonzini in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2007-01/msg00077.html
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Signed Overflow Examples): Give more
	discussion about the allow_superuser_privileges example,
	and change it a bit to make things clearer.
	(Optimization and Wraparound): Clarify whether the compiler
	will generate an infinite loop for the example derived from
	Autoconf's mktime test.
	(Signed Overflow Advice): Say that -ftrapv is meant for debugging.
	Also, clarify unsigned multiplication overflow.

2007-01-04  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* bin/Makefile.am (RELEASE_YEAR): New macro.
	(edit): Use it to supply correct copyright year to scripts.
	* bin/autoconf.as (version): Use it.
	* bin/autoheader.in ($version): Likewise.
	* bin/autom4te.in ($version): Likewise.
	* bin/autoreconf.in ($version): Likewise.
	* bin/autoscan.in ($version): Likewise.
	* bin/autoupdate.in ($version): Likewise.
	* bin/ifnames.in ($version): Likewise.

2007-01-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Integer Overflow): Revised based on today's
	feedback.  The most important changes document what happens when
	you convert an out-of-range value to a signed integer type, and
	say that (sum < a) != (b < 0) reliably detects overflow when sum =
	a + b.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Integer Overflow): Greatly expand and
	rewrite, taking notions from the recent discussion on the gcc and
	autoconf mailing lists; please see
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-12/msg00091.html
	and follow the many links.
	(Integer Overflow Basics, Signed Overflow Examples):
	(Optimization and Wraparound, Signed Overflow Advice):
	(Signed Integer Division): New sections.

2006-12-28  Steven G. Johnson  <stevenj@alum.mit.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_DEFINE_TRACE): Don't include
	preprocessor macro arguments in traced name.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Defining symbols): Document longstanding
	support for AC_DEFINE-ing macros with arguments, and document
	behavior when the same variable has multiple AC_DEFINEs.
	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_FC_WRAPPERS): Revert to the
	old implementation which AC_DEFINEs the FC_FUNC and FC_FUNC_
	macros directly, giving much shorter and simpler code.

2006-12-28  Malcolm Purvis <malcolmp@xemacs.org>  (trivial change)

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Insert a
	space before "$ac_configure_args" to prevent a 'config.status
	--recheck' failure if ac_configure_args doesn't contain a leading
	space.  This works around a problem with the XEmacs configure.ac,
	which uses the (undocumented) ac_configure_args variable
	inconsistently with Autoconf.

2006-12-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_MKTIME):
	Include <limits.h>, and use its INT_MAX to rewrite the
	j loop so that it does not overflow 'int'.  Problem reported by
	Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2006-12/msg00084.html>.
	Play it safe by shifting left by 1 rather than multiplying by 2,
	as GCC is less likely to optimize this away when the value
	is signed (when it assumes overflow leads to undefined behavior).
	Also, don't assume time_t uses two's complement.

2006-12-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/torture.at (Substitute a 2000-byte string): Avoid using
	a 10kB long (multi-line) string literal, OpenServer 5.0.7 ksh
	dumps core on it.  Report by Tim Rice.

2006-12-18  Steven G. Johnson  <stevenj@alum.mit.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_ARG_ENABLE): Print help about
	--disable-option-checking to --help output even when
	AC_PRESERVE_HELP_ORDER is not used.
	(_AC_INIT_PARSE_ENABLE2): Print warnings using actual --enable or
	--with argument, rather than argument with [-.] replaced by
	underscores.
	* NEWS: Fix typo in previous change; the news was in the
	wrong section.

2006-12-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Warnings are now generated by default for unknown
	--enable-* and --with-* options.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Option Checking): Renamed from
	(Configure Option Checking).  Tighten up the wording a bit.
	(External Software, Package Options): Cross-reference to Option
	Checking, and use this to shorten our section.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS): Prefer test -n
	"$x" to test "x$foo" != x.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (AC_OUTPUT): Likewise.
	Don't warn if $enable_option_checking is "no".
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS): Initialize
	ac_unrecognized_opts to the empty string.
	Don't echo the unrecognized opts, as this might mishandle
	backslashes or leading -.
	(AC_PRESERVE_HELP_ORDER): Put the --disable-option-checking
	usage next to the other --disable-FEATURE options in the
	help string.

2006-12-18  Steven G. Johnson  <stevenj@alum.mit.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_DEFAULTS, _AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS):
	(_AC_INIT_PARSE_ENABLE2, _AC_INIT_HELP, _AC_ENABLE_IF):
	Print warning for unrecognized --with and --enable options
	(AC_DISABLE_OPTION_CHECKING): New macro to disable warnings.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS, _AC_OUTPUT_SUBDIRS):
	Disable option checking when subdirs are configured.
	(AC_OUTPUT): If warnings are enabled, print warning about
	unrecognized --with and --enable options at the end of
	the configure output (as well as at the beginning).
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Option Checking): New node.
	Document new option warning functionality.

2006-12-16  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump version, since 2.61a is released.
	* NEWS: Start news for current version.

2006-12-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_GETMNTENT):
	Define HAVE_GETMNTENT to 1, not to the empty string.
	Problem originally reported by Jochen Friedrich in
	<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=403243>.

	This change prompted by a problem report by Andrey Simonenko in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-12/msg00026.html>.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Defining Symbols): AC_DEFINE works for
	object-like macros only, in the traditional portable character
	set.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_DEFINE_TRACE_LITERAL):
	Warn about attempts to define things that are not identifiers.
	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_FC_WRAPPERS): Rewrite to avoid
	awful hack that AC_DEFINEd macro names containing parentheses.

2006-12-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Undo some of the 2006-12-10 change.  It was
	too drastic, even if Texinfo in theory requires it for info mode.

	(config.status Invocation): Renamed back from Recreating a
	Configuration).
	(Obsolete config.status Use): Renamed back from Obsolete Recreation.
	(Autoconf 2.13): Renamed back from 20th-century Autoconf 2.

2006-12-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Version 2.61a.

2006-12-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* NEWS: Document changes with echo and printf, and the lack
	of limits on the total size of multi-line values of substituted
	variables, and the AC_FUNC_FSEEKO fix.

2006-12-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Writing Autoconf Input): Renamed from
	Writing configure.ac.
	(Autoconf Input Layout): Renamed from configure.ac Layout.
	(Recreating a Configuration): Renamed from config.status Invocation.
	(Obsolete Recreation): Renamed from Obsolete config.status Use.
	(acconfig Header): Renamed from acconfig.h.
	(20th-century Autoconf 2): Renamed from Autoconf 2.13.
	(Writing Testsuites): Renamed from Writing testsuite.at.
	(Autom4te Cache): Renamed from autom4te.cache.

	* BUGS: Remove mention of VPATH problem, since it's now documented
	not to be a bug in the Autoconf build procedure itself, but rather
	a problem with the proprietary `make' programs.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Build Directories): Add a cross reference
	to VPATH and Make.

	* build-aux/config.guess, build-aux/config.sub, build-aux/texinfo.tex:
	* doc/standards.texi: Sync from gnulib.

	* man/autoconf.1, man/autoheader.1, man/autom4te.1, man/autoreconf.1:
	* man/autoscan.1, man/autoupdate.1, man/config.guess.1:
	* man/config.sub.1, man/ifnames.1: Remove from CVS, since they're
	generated automatically.

2006-12-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (_AC_PROG_CC_C89): Also try -xc99=all, for Sun
	C 5.8 on Solaris 10.  Using -xc99=all rather than -xc99 bypasses
	the buggy -xc99 option of Forte Developer 7 C on Solaris 9.

2006-12-07  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): Drop the
	`CEOF$ac_eof' special marker, the awk script cannot contain a
	line matching `^CEOF', so this is not needed any more.
	* tests/torture.at (Substitute a newline): Expose the `%!_!# '
	special marker in the test.

2006-12-06  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* tests/tools.at (autom4te preselections): Use `find -newer';
	remove one of the sleeps.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PARSE_ENABLE): Make it
	more readable, using ...
	(_AC_INIT_PARSE_ENABLE2): ... this new helper macro.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (autoheader Invocation): Do not double-
	quote the parameter of `AH_BOTTOM' in the example.

2006-12-05  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Configuration Headers): Remove the
	example with multiple input files.
	(autoheader Invocation): Encourage `AH_BOTTOM', discouraging
	multiple input files.

2006-12-05  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): When
	creating the awk substitution script, handle one input line at a
	time, so that the maximum length of a substituted (multi-line)
	value is not limited by the size of the sed pattern space.
	The trade-off is a slightly repetitive sed script.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Branch labels
	can only have up to 7 characters, due to Solaris 10 /bin/sed.
	* tests/torture.at (Substitute a 2000-byte string): Increase the
	test with several long lines, they should not be caught by sed
	limits any more.

	* tests/tools.at (autom4te preselections): New test, to flag
	entries missing from autom4te.cfg.
	Report by David Byron <dbyron@hheld.com>.

	* tests/torture.at (Substitute a 2000-byte string): Actually use
	AC_PROG_AWK, so the last change works as intended.
	(Substitute and define special characters): Likewise.
	(Substitute a newline): Likewise.

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): Use `$AWK'
	instead of `awk' consistently.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Initialize $AWK.
	* tests/torture.at (Torturing config.status): Test both the
	result of AC_PROG_AWK and plain awk.
	(Substitute a 2000-byte string): Likewise.
	(Substitute and define special characters): Likewise.
	(Substitute a newline): Likewise.

2006-12-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_FSEEKO): Check that fseeko
	can be assigned to a function pointer.  Problem reported by
	Peter Palfrader in <http://bugs.debian.org/401377>.  Based on
	part of a patch by Ralf Wildenhues in that same bug report.

2006-12-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/mktests.sh (ac_exclude_list): Exclude AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED.
	* tests/semantics.at (AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED): New test.

2006-12-01  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_LANG_INT_SAVE): Avoid newline, to aid in
	cross-compiling from cygwin to mingw.
	Reported by Bob Rossi.  This resurrects the 2000-11-30 patch to
	aclang.m4, which was mistakenly removed in the 2001-09-17 patch
	to lib/autoconf/c.m4.

2006-12-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_ECHO_PREPARE): Use a longer test
	string for more reliable failure.  Wrap the entire test that
	causes the broken Solaris printf to dump core, in a subshell,
	so the segmentation fault message is reliably suppressed.
	Fix shell expansion errors by using /usr/ucb/echo always;
	avoid an error on systems without it by another subshell.
	Avoid m4 expansion of `$1'.  Set the zeroth argument of the
	subshell-$as_echo to `as_echo', for better error message.

2006-11-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_CACHE_DUMP): If `BASH_ARGV' or
	`BASH_SOURCE' contain a newline, set them to empty, as they may
	not be unset.

2006-11-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Turn AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED into a noop.  It's been obsolete for
	years and is too hard to maintain now.  The last straw was
	reported by Jerker Baeck in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2006-11/msg00102.html>.
	* NEWS: AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED is now obsolete.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Functions): Move
	AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED from here...
	(Obsolete Macros): ... to here.  Say that it does nothing now.
	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED):
	Turn into (almost) a no-op.

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_GCC_TRADITIONAL, AC_C_CONST):
	(AC_C_VOLATILE):
	Do not recommend via AN_FUNCTION, AN_IDENTIFIER, or AN_HEADER.
	These macros are obsolescent and new applications shouldn't need them.
	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_CLOSEDIR_VOID, AC_REPLACE_FNMATCH):
	(AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG, AC_FUNC_GETPGRP, AC_FUNC_MEMCMP):
	(AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES, AC_FUNC_SETPGRP, AC_FUNC_STAT, AC_FUNC_LSTAT):

	* lib/autoconf/headers.m4 (AC_HEADER_DIRENT, AC_HEADER_STAT):
	(AC_HEADER_STDC, AC_HEADER_SYS_WAIT, AC_HEADER_TIME): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (AC_STRUCT_TM): Likewise.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Setting Output Variables): Mention that
	@VAR1@VAR2 has unspecified behavior.  Problem reported by
	Ralf Wildenhues.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	* Makefile.am: Put only a single '#' into the copyright notice,
	so that it's also present in the output file.  Standardize wording
	in makefile copyright notices to match GNU coding standards.
	* bin/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* doc/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* lib/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* lib/freeze.mk: Likewise.

	* lib/m4sugar/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* man/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* lib/emacs/Makefile.am: Remove copyright notice; it's just a
	one-line file.

2006-11-27  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): Fix error
	in the sed script that mangles the awk script: delete up to the
	first exclamation mark only.
	* tests/torture.at (Substitute and define special characters):
	Test '!' too.

2006-11-26  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Rewrite config files generation: avoid quadratic growth in
	the number of substituted variables by using awk instead of sed
	for the bulk of the substitutions.
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Setting Output Variables): `|#_!!_#|' is also
	forbidden in the output (and thus input) file.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_AWK_LITERAL_LIMIT): New macro.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): Instead of several sed scripts,
	generate just one large awk script for substitutions,
	eliminating much of the earlier complexity, while adding some
	new complexity.  Only expand the substitution templates at
	configure time, for smaller configure script size.  If
	_AC_SUBST_FILES are used, test 'awk' for working getline support
	at config.status time.  If absent, interpolate through the
	shell.  The awk script was written with much help
	from Paolo Bonzini and Paul Eggert.
	(_AC_SED_CMD_NUM, _AC_SED_DELIM_NUM, _AC_SED_FRAG): Removed.
	(_AC_SED_FRAG_NUM): Likewise.
	(_AC_SUBST_CMDS): Renamed from...
	(_AC_SED_CMDS): ...this.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): Use _AC_SUBST_CMDS.
	* tests/torture.at (Substitute a 2000-byte string): Also
	substitute a line with 1000 words, and a variable with several
	long lines.
	(Substitute and define special characters): Test awk special
	characters, and put substitution input strings `@foo@' in the
	output, to test that no recursion happens; test several other
	combinations from Paolo Bonzini.

2006-11-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Undo recent changes
	that replaced echo with AS_ECHO where this wasn't necessary.
	Problem reportd by Ralf Wildenhues.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_ECHO_PREPARE): Port to Solaris 7,
	where "/usr/bin/printf '%s\n' S" dumps core if S is long.
	This is Sun bug 4206210.  Problem reportd by Ralf Wildenhues.

2006-11-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/freeze.mk (GREP): Removed, no need to initialize this.

2006-11-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Don't claim
	that traditional Awk lacks 3-arg "split".  It has it.
	Mention that FS must be a single character, and a few other
	99-byte limits of traditional Awk.
	Mention that if (i in a) doesn't work with traditional Awk.

2006-11-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/autotest.at (BSx641-newline in command):
	(BS-BS-newline in command, BSx640-newline in command):
	(Newline-CODE-BS-newline in command):
	(Single-quote-BS-newline in command):
	(Single-quote-newline-BS-newline in command):
	Use printf '%s\n' instead of echo, for portability to hosts
	where echo interprets backslashes.  This will break on hosts
	that lack printf, but for now let's assume all such hosts
	are dead (if not, we should get reports of test failures).

2006-11-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	'echo' has some portability problems, when given a first argument
	with a leading '-', or when given any argument containing '\'.
	Avoid using 'echo' in these cases.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_MSG_RESULT, AC_MSG_RESULT_UNQUOTED):
	Don't use ECHO_T, since ECHO_N is now reliable.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_ARG_PROGRAM): Use sed "$script"

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_VAR_GET): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_FEATURE_CHECK_LENGTH): Use

2006-10-27  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Builtins): Do not invoke

2006-10-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe for Coreutils 6.4.

	* tests/tools.at (autoconf --trace: user macros): Remove test
	for tracing multiline macros, since m4 1.4.7a uses a different
	way to number lines.  Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

2006-10-24  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* bin/autom4te.in (handle_m4): Do not redirect stdin to
	/dev/null since the heuristics for interactive behaviour was
	fixed in CVS m4.

	* bin/autom4te.in: With --force, always refresh the output
	file.  Problem reported by Greg Schafer <gschafer@zip.com.au>.

	* bin/autoconf.as: Fix the verbose message at the end.

2006-10-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	(Imported from Automake.)
	* build-aux/install-sh (posix_mkdir): Reject FreeBSD 6.1 mkdir -p -m,
	which incorrectly sets the mode of an existing destination
	directory.  In some cases the unpatched install-sh could do the
	equivalent of "chmod 777 /" or "chmod 0 /" on a buggy FreeBSD
	system.  We hope this is rare in practice, but it's clearly worth
	fixing.  Problem reported by Alex Unleashed in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-10/msg00012.html>.
	Also, don't bother to check for -m bugs unless we're using -m;
	suggested by Stepan Kasal.

2006-10-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Report from Bruno Haible.

	2006-03-10  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>
	* lib/Autom4te/ChannelDefs.pm: Make -Wportability the default in

	Import this change from Gnulib:

	2006-09-16  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>
	* doc/fdl.texi (ADDENDUM): switch to @heading from @appendixsubsec,

	2006-08-26  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>
	* build-aux/texinfo.tex (\textdegree): New command.

	2006-08-12  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>

2006-10-13  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_OBSTACK): In the test,
	include the default headers, and redefine obstack_chunk_alloc
	and obstack_chunk_free.  Fixes false failure with glibc.

2006-10-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_TEST_PREPARE): Set as_executable_p,
	for backward compatibility with Libtool 1.5.22.  Problem reported
	by Ralf Wildenhues.

2006-10-12  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_GCC_TRADITIONAL): Require
	AC_PROG_CC.
	Report by IOhannes m zmoelnig <zmoelnig@iem.at>.

2006-10-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Posix Variants): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/specific.m4 (AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS): Likewise.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_TEST_X): New macro.
	(AS_EXECUTABLE_P): Use as_test_x rather than as_executable_p.
	(_AS_TEST_PREPARE): Set as_test_x rather than as_executable_p.
	Use a better substitute, by inspecting the output of "ls"
	rather than just using ":".
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_LINK_IFELSE): Use AS_TEST_X
	rather than AS_EXECUTABLE_P, since we needn't worry about
	non-regular files here.

	* NEWS: Autoconf-generated shell scripts no longer export BIN_SH,
	due to configuration hassles with this.  See Tonya Underwood's report
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-10/msg00003.html>.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Shell Variables): Likewise.

2006-10-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	    Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_BOURNE_COMPATIBLE): Don't set BIN_SH.
	(_AS_DETECT_BETTER_SHELL): Don't look in /usr/bin/posix.

2006-10-11  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	comment about ac_cpp_err; it was incorrect, and anyway
	ac_cpp_err is being removed below.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_PREPROC_IFELSE): Don't
	set ac_cpp_err to 'yesyes' if preproc_warn_flag and werror_flag
	are both 'yes'.  In fact, don't bother setting ac_cpp_err at all;
	nobody uses it.
	(_AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, _AC_LINK_IFELSE): Don't log our funky tests
	with werror_flag and conftest.err and so forth.  This is more
	compatible with how _AC_PROG_PREPROC_WORKS_IFELSE behaves,
	and anyway the user shouldn't normally want to see this gorp logged.
	Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues.
	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (AC_LANG_WERROR): werror_flag's default is
	empty, not 'no', since the rest of the code uses 'test -z'.

2006-10-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, _AC_LINK_IFELSE):

	Problem reported by mwoehlke in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-10/msg00048.html>.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_TEST_PREPARE): Use "test -x /" rather
	than creating a file to use with test -x; this is much faster.

2006-10-02  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* lib/autom4te.in (Automake-preselections): Add
	AM_GNU_GETTEXT_INTL_SUBDIR, for automake 1.10.

2006-09-27  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Writing testsuite.at): Fix a typo: for

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_FSEEKO): Don't compile the
	fseeko testing program twice; just use the earlier result.
	* lib/autoconf/specific.m4 (_AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_MACRO_VALUE):
	Set cache var to 'unknown' (not 'no') if leaving the macro unset
	still doesn't let the program compile.
	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE): Test for _LARGE_FILES only if earlier tests
	failed.

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4: Fix problems reported by Ralf Wildenhues.
	(AC_FUNC_ERROR_AT_LINE): Don't bother to check for error.h.  Just
	include it, without including anything else.
	(AC_FUNC_FSEEKO): Avoid gcc -Wall warnings about constant
	expressions.
	(AC_FUNC_STRNLEN): Require AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS.

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_ERROR_AT_LINE): Check for

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_WAIT3): Include <sys/wait.h>,
	for a declaration of wait3.

2006-09-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: AC_CHECK_DECL now also works with aggregate objects.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Generic Declarations): Clarify that AC_CHECK_DECL
	can apply to constants too, and that it checks for macro defns.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_CHECK_DECL): Assume C89 or better,
	and simply cast the identifier to void.  This handles structure
	values.  Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

2006-09-26  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_LEX): Let _AC_PROG_LEX_YYTEXT_DECL
	deal with LEXLIB.
	(_AC_PROG_LEX_YYTEXT_DECL): Handle caching correctly; the old code

	broken lex libraries like native ia64-hp-hpux11.22; see
	<http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2003-12/msg00337.html>, and
	work around the problem by preferring an empty LEXLIB to -lfl or
	-ll.  Let the user set LEXLIB='' to indicate no library needed.

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Be more consistent about using @acronym with

	quite right (it talked about "OSF/Tru64", even though the
	operating systems were called OSF/1, Digital UNIX, and Tru64 UNIX,
	and it even mentioned "OSF 4"!) and at this point there's little
	reason to talk about OSF any more, since it died in 1994.
	(Specific Compiler Characteristics): Simplify example of
	negative-size array.
	(File Descriptors): Reorder to make the text flow better.

	* bin/autom4te.in (handle_output): Do not forbid the empty
	pattern.
	* tests/tools.at (autoconf: the empty token): New test.

2006-06-20  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_init): Merge the two m4_wrap
	calls, so that we do not care whether they are LIFO or FIFO;
	in the m4_wrap, do not check which diversion is the topmost
	one, just check that the stack is balanced at the end.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_INIT): We are going to change the
	base diversion forever--pop the previous diversion before
	opening the new one; consequently, remove the m4_wrap call.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Likewise.
	* tests/m4sugar.at: Do not use
	m4_wrap([m4_diversion_pop([..])]), for educational purposes.

2006-06-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* NEWS: Document that m4wrap/m4_wrap might not be LIFO.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Redefined M4 Macros): Likewise.
	Rework example of m4wrap token-pasting trouble so that it doesn't
	care whether it's LIFO or FIFO.
	Fix some "contrary to"s that are awkward in English.

2006-06-19  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (_AC_TYPE_INT): Set `$ac_cv_c_int$1_t'
	to `yes' instead of `int$1_t' if the type is found, for more
	consistent configure output (where $1 is the number of bits).
	(_AC_TYPE_UINT): Likewise for `uint$1_t'.
	Suggested by Bruno Haible.

	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (_AC_TYPE_UNSIGNED_INT): Solaris 2.5.1
	needs _UINT8_T and _UINT64_T defines as well, to avoid clashes
	with system headers.  Report by Bruno Haible.

2006-06-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* config/config.guess, config/config.sub: Sync from upstream.

	* bin/Makefile.am (autoconf.in): Use `--melt' for autom4te,
	in order to avoid picking up an older installed frozen m4sh.m4f.
	Besides an outdated shell startup, this could have been created
	by an earlier M4 version with incompatible frozen file format.

2006-06-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* README: Recommend m4 1.4.4 instead of 1.4.3..
	* doc/autoconf.texi: Likewise.
	(Special Chars in Names): Say that $(.FOO) is portable, as
	suggested by Stepan Kasal.
	(Installation Directory Variables, Build Directories):
	(Automatic Remaking, Subdirectories, Fortran Compiler):
	(Making testsuite Scripts, Defining Directories):
	Quote variable usages better.
	(Making testsuite Scripts): Add clean-local rule to makefile
	snippet, by Eric Blake.
	(Installation Directory Variables): Fix table item font.
	Reword slightly to clarify.  Generalize advice about
	not using special characters to include all file-related
	vars, not just VPATH.
	(Special Chars in Variables): Warn about special characters in
	$(srcdir) too.
	(Assignments): Clarify default-value example as suggested by
	Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-06/msg00072.html>.
	(Special Shell Variables): Note leading ./ or ../, as suggested
	by Eric Blake.
	(Limitations of Builtins): Under cd, warn about CDPATH.
	(The Make Macro MAKEFLAGS): Untabify.  Problem reported by
	Ralf Wildenhues.

2006-06-15  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Configuration Actions): Remove duplicate
	`@var', for texi2html.
	(Systemology): Some more word wrapping, for DVI output.
	(autom4te Invocation): The short option for `--melt' is `-M',
	not `-m'.

2006-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: More formatting and English tweaks,
	many suggested by Ralf Wildenhues.
	Reword to avoid "@code{...}'s" and the like, since it's ugly
	with Emacs info mode.  discontents -> woes.
	Put a few "will"s back.  time stamp -> timestamp.
	side-effect -> side effect.

2006-06-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Initializing configure, Shell Substitutions):
	Warn about $@ not persisting.  Problem reported by Julien Danjou in
	<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=372179>.
	(Special Chars in Names): Renamed from Leading _ in Macro Names.
	Mention other special chars, too.

2006-06-14  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (The Make Macro MAKEFLAGS): New node.

2006-06-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Some systematic minor improvements, as
	follows.  Use "makefile" when talking about makefiles
	generally (which might be named "makefile" or "Makefile" or even
	"foo.mk"), "Makefile" when talking about a specific makefile
	called "Makefile".  This unclutters the text from weird quotes
	(e.g., "`Makefile's" in info mode).  Similarly, use "@var{foo}
	values" rather than "@var{foo}s" and similar constructs containing
	"}s".  Use "Make rules" rather than "Makefile rules".  Minor
	English-language improvements.  Change the prefix "sub-" to "sub"
	and "re-" to "re".
	Put blank lines around examples more consistently.
	Avoid "rather" and "very" as intensifiers.
	Avoid "will" as an auxiliary.
	(Limitations of Make): Split this node into....
	(Portable Make, $< in Ordinary Make Rules, Failure in Make Rules):
	(Leading _ in Macro Names, Backslash-Newline-Newline):
	(Backslash-Newline Comments, Long Lines in Makefiles):
	(Macros and Submakes, The Make Macro SHELL, Comments in Make Rules):
	(obj/ and Make, make -k Status, VPATH and Make):
	(VPATH and Double-colon, $< in Explicit Rules):
	(Automatic Rule Rewriting, OSF/Tru64 Directory Magic):
	(Make Target Lookup, Single Suffix Rules, Timestamps and Make):
	New nodes, resulting from splitup of Limitations of Make.
	All cross-references changed.  Raise the top node from
	a section to a chapter, and all subnodes accordingly.
	Redo the introductory wording to match the new organization.
	(Installation Directory Variables): Use an example that is
	closer to what Autoconf actually does.  Mention that VPATH's
	value should not contain metacharacters or white space.
	(Fortran Compiler): Fix a VPATH bug in an example.
	(Leading _ in Macro Names): Mention that this problem is no longer
	of practical concern.
	(VPATH and Make): Reword the advice to make it clearer
	that Autoconf and Automake support VPATH in non-GNU make, but
	many packages have bugs in this area.
	($< in Explicit Rules): Refer to Build Directories rather
	than using a (non-VPATH-safe) example.
	(Automatic Rule Rewriting): Mention the sort of disaster that
	can ensue with Solaris-style rule rewriting with VPATH.

2006-06-13  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/install.texi (Compilers and Options): Weaken the
	suggestion to use GNU make for VPATH builds.

	* lib/autom4te.in (Automake-preselections): Add AM_PROG_CXX_C_O,
	AM_PROG_F77_C_O, AM_PROG_FC_C_O, AC_FC_SRCEXT, AC_FC_FREEFORM.

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_MAKE_SET): Fix M4 quotation
	in regular expression.

2006-06-08  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Installation Directory Variables):
	Drop extra @samp from `@table @samp' item.
	(Limitations of Usual Tools): Comment fix.
	Do not nest @samp just to point to other table items.
	(Writing testsuite.at) <AT_CHECK>: The second argument to
	`@dvar' is already @samp'ed.
	(Making testsuite Scripts) <AC_CONFIG_TESTDIR>: Likewise,
	do not use @var in the second argument.

2006-06-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_DETECT_BETTER_SHELL): Look for
	$as_shell.exe too.  Problem reported by Andreas Buening in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2006-06/msg00038.html>.

2006-06-07  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_ALLOCA): Work around
	`unused variable' compiler warning, for `-Wall -Werror'.
	Reported by Jaap Haitsma in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-06/msg00012.html>.

2006-06-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC_C_O): Remove core file, in
	case the compiler dumps core.  Problem reported for
	OpenServer 5.0.7 by Tim Rice in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-06/msg00019.html>.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, _AC_LINK_IFELSE):
	Likewise.

2006-06-06  Tim Rice <tim@multitalents.net>.

	* lib/freeze.mk: Quiet check-forbidden-patterns so the string
	"ERROR" only shows up in "make check" output if there is an
	error.

2006-06-06  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* tests/tools.at (automatically allowed tokens): Fix typo.

2006-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Don't blame non-GNU VPATH compatibility issues on Automake.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Integer Overflow): Mention that INT_MIN % -1
	typically overflows on x86 CPUs, even though the C standard
	requires otherwise.

2006-06-05  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 2.59e.
	* NEWS: Update.

	Version 2.59d.

	* config/texinfo.tex: Sync from upstream.

	* bin/autoreconf.in: Trace `LT_CONFIG_LTDL_DIR'; if it has been
	seen, invoke libtoolize with `--ltdl' argument.
	* lib/autom4te.in (Autoreconf-preselections): Adjust.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Suggested by Eric Blake.

2006-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2006-06-05  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_require): Modify the error
	message issued by AC_REQUIRE.
	* tests/m4sugar.at: Check m4_require's error message.
	* tests/base.at: Check AC_REQUIRE's error message.
	* tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_M4): New macro, almost identical
	to...
	(AT_CHECK_AUTOM4TE): ... which is now a thin wrapper around
	AT_CHECK_M4.
	(AT_CHECK_AUTOCONF): Use AT_CHECK_M4; no longer support
	`expout' as the last parameter.
	* tests/tools.at: Adapt to the above change.

2006-06-04  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Correct
	information about race-free implementations of mkdir.

2006-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: GNU make now recommended for VPATH builds.
	Mention that some macros are now documented to be obsolescent.
	* doc/autoconf.texi:
	Prefer "current" to "modern" to describe
	currently-used (albeit perhaps old-fashioned) hosts.
	Mention which ancient features no longer need to be worried about.
	setgid -> set-group-ID
	setuid -> set-user-ID (these are the Posix terms)
	Fix some misuses of "only".
	(AC_C_BACKSLASH_A, AC_C_CONST, AC_C_PROTOTYPES):

	(AC_PROG_GCC_TRADITIONAL, AC_STRUCT_TM):
	Mention that these macros are obsolescent.
	(Installation Directory Variables): shall -> should
	(File Descriptors): Mention that 0, 1, 2 might get reopened.
	Mention that it's now safe to use 3 and 4.
	(Limitations of Usual Tools): cp -r is now specified by Posix.
	Omit longwinded and obsolescent discussion of cp -f.
	Modernize discussion of expr, ls.
	(Limitations of Make): Modernize discussion of VPATH builds.
	Mention $? as a workaround in some cases.
	* doc/install.texi (Basic Installation):
	Mention "./configure; make; make install" first.  Be more
	specific about why this file is generic.  Remove unnecessary
	parens.  Remove misleading "only".  Remove obsolete advice
	about csh.  Don't say "configure" takes awhile; say it
	might take a while.  Suggest CFLAGS=-g rather than CFLAGS=-O2,
	and CC=c99 rather than CC=c89, as these are blessed by current
	Posix.  Recommend GNU make if doing a VPATH build.

2006-06-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Use a consistent style "$ @kbd{...}" for
	examples involving shell prompts.

2006-06-02  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	and Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Here-Documents): Add details about the

	anywhere in directory names.

2006-05-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_DO_ECHO): Be even more conservative
	about quoting the case statement, just in case.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Here-Documents): Mention that the ksh bug
	was fixed in ksh93g; reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

2006-05-31  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	argument with leading hyphen.  Problem reported by Paul Eggert.

2006-05-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_DO_ECHO): Be more conservative
	about quoting ac_try: quote all of it, if any of it seems suspicious.
	This means we don't have to worry about ${ or sed any more.
	Also, double-quote the case statement, to work around misuses via
	underquoting as reported by Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-05/msg00169.html>.
	(_AC_EVAL_STDERR): Revert, since evidently some packages rely on this
	undocumented and dangerous macro.
	Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-05/msg00168.html>.

2006-05-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4: Revert AC_TRY_EVAL and AC_TRY_COMMAND,

	Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-05/msg00160.html>.
	(AC_TRY_EVAL, AC_TRY_COMMAND, _AC_EVAL): Go back to the
	pre-2006-05-26 definitions, but leave in the comments that
	these macros are dangerous and should not be used.

	(_AC_DO): Renamed from _AC_EVAL.  All callers changed.
	(_AC_DO_STDERR): Renamed from _AC_EVAL_STDERR.  All callers changed.
	(_AC_DO_VAR): Renamed from AC_TRY_EVAL.

2006-05-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (AC_OUTPUT_MAKE_DEFS): Rewrite to avoid
	the use of 'tr', since this is our only use of 'tr'.

2006-05-29  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>
	and Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE):
	Don't assume 'grep' works on long lines, since AIX grep doesn't.

2005-05-28  Ralf Wildenhues <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): Do not use `grep' on
	the output file in the `${datarootdir}' test.

2005-05-28  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	and Ralf Wildenhues <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): If we have not seen
	mention of `datarootdir' in the input file(s), but literal
	`${datarootdir}' in the output file, and we haven't warned yet,
	then warn as well: the user may have (erroneously) used
	`AC_SUBST([mydatadir], [$datadir/my])' instead of the correct
	`AC_SUBST([mydatadir], ['${datadir}/my'])'.
	* tests/torture.at (datarootdir workaround): Extend this test.
	* NEWS: Update.

2006-05-27  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>
	and Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (autoheader Invocation): The first argument to
	`AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED' need not be a literal.  Mention the
	alternatives and clear up the language a bit.

2006-05-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Reword notice for AC_TRY_COMMAND, AC_TRY_EVAL,
	ac_config_guess, ac_config_sub, ac_configure.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS):
	Fix typo that prevented an unnecessary space from being removed.
	Problems reported by Ralf Wildenhues in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-05/msg00143.html

2006-05-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs, Limitations of Usual Tools):
	Use better wording to talk about AC_PROG_MKDIR_P's thread-safety.
	Don't use the term "thread-safe" to talk about mkdir race
	conditions, since the problem is more a process than a thread
	issue.  Problem reported by Stepan Kasal in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-05/msg00088.html
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_MKDIR_P): Use code that mimics
	the test for 'install' more closely.  Look at MKDIR_P first.
	Look in the PATH, and at /opt/sfw/bin.
	Look for a 'gmkdir' program as well (Solaris 10 /opt/sfw/bin/gmkdir).
	Don't bother to try mkdir -p, since we already check mkdir --version;
	just look at the version number.  (There's no easy way to check
	for race-free implementations.)
	* tests/tools.at (autoconf: subdirectories): Adjust to above
	changes, since MKDIR_P now might end in "/mkdir -p".

	* doc/autoconf.texi (autoheader Invocation): Mention that the
	first arg of AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED must be a literal.
	Problem reported by Ben Pfaff in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-05/msg00090.html>.

	* NEWS: Mention that AC_TRY_COMMAND and AC_TRY_EVAL may be removed.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Chars in Variables): New section.
	(Preset Output Variables): Warn about special chars in CPPFLAGS.
	(Installation Directory Variables): Quote $(datadir) better.
	(Limitations of Builtins): Describe some of eval's trickiness.

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC_C_O): Simplify quoting.
	* lib/autoconf/fortram.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC_V_OUTPUT): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Put leading space
	in front of every arg, not just trailing args.  Quote apostrophes.
	(_AC_EVAL_ECHO): New macro.
	(_AC_EVAL, AC_EVAL_STDERR): Use it.  Quote arg of eval.
	(AC_TRY_EVAL, AC_TRY_COMMAND): Mention that these macros might get
	removed.
	(_AC_LINK_IFELSE): Use proper rule for shell continuation lines,
	exposed by quoting of eval argument.  Put the command on line line
	so it logs better.
	* lib/autoconf/libs.m4 (_AC_PATH_X_XMKMF): Use eval more safely.
	(_AC_PATH_X, AC_PATH_X): Quote more safely.
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_MAKE_SET): Use eval more safely.
	* lib/autoconf/specific.m4 (AC_SYS_LONG_FILE_NAMES): Don't use eval.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_SUBDIRS): Minor style change.
	Handle special chars in prefix, ac_srcdir, ac_aux_dir.
	Use eval more safely.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Adjust to above changes.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_VAR_GET): Note that this API needs
	to be replaced.
	* tests/base.at (AC_TRY_COMMAND): Use proper rule for shell continuation
	lines, exposed by quoting of eval argument.

2006-05-26  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT): Drop the
	initialization of `ac_cv_exeext', do not override it if it was
	already set, unless it was set to `no', for compatibility with
	Autoconf-2.13, and comment this.
	Do not export `ac_cv_exeext', Libtool hasn't needed this for years.
	(_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT): Likewise, do not export it.
	(_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_WORKS, _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_CROSS): Typos.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Compilers and Preprocessors) <EXEEXT>:
	Document that this test may be overridden by setting
	`ac_cv_exeext'.

2006-05-26  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Revert these two patches:

	2006-04-06  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>
	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_O): Inside cache
	check, s/ac_exeext/ac_cv_exeext/.  Fixes regression introduced
	2006-04-01.

	2006-04-01  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	Clean up _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT* macros.
	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT): Don't try to
	  detect exeext, it will be done by _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_O; just set
	  ac_file to the name of the default output file and call
	  _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_WORKS.  Move the definition of ac_files and the
	  initial `rm' of the candidate files...
	(_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT): ... here and simplify them.  Moreover, use
	  the same list in subsequent `rm' calls, and for the temporary
	  redefinition of ac_clean_files; call _AC_COMPILER_OBJEXT at the end,
	  and don't call the other _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_* macros directly, use...
	(_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_TESTS): ... this new macro.
	(_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_O): Don't export ac_cv_exeext, it's not needed (or
	  no longer needed) by libtool.  Make it a cache check.
	(_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_CROSS): Remove the comment, it was obviously
	  copied here by mistake.
	(AC_NO_EXECUTABLES): Redefine _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_TESTS, not
	  _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT.
	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC, AC_PROG_CXX, AC_PROG_OBJC): Do not call
	  _AC_COMPILER_OBJEXT directly.
	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC): Likewise.

2006-05-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools) < sed (`t')>:
	Fix description of how the buggy `sed' works.

2006-05-25  Noah Misch  <noah@cs.caltech.edu>

	Sync from Automake:

	* lib/Autom4te/XFile.pm (lock): Allow EOPNOTSUPP, besides
	ENOLCK.  Only mention `make -j' when applicable.  Only raise
	fatal errors when `make -j' is involved.  Improve error message.

2006-05-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Here-Documents): We now know more about
	the variable expansion in here documents bug.
	Thanks to Tim Rice and Stepan Kasal.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Making testsuite Scripts): Add an example
	how to use TESTSUITEFLAGS.  Suggested by Eric Blake.

2006-05-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/autotest.at (Multiline command from M4 expansion):
	No failure to be expected if the shell quotes newlines in
	commands in the `set -x' output.  Report by Tim Rice.
	* THANKS: Update.

2006-05-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_HEADER): Don't use shell
	expansion in the here-documents used by config.status, as that
	runs afoul of the Korn shell version M-12/28/93d bug described in
	the Autoconf manual, and this in turn causes a Coreutils 5.95 build to
	fail as described by Tim Rice and diagnosed by Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-05/msg00082.html>.

2006-05-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_LSTAT_FOLLOWS_SLASHED_SYMLINK):
	Fix typo introduced with 2006-04-02 change.  It reversed the sense
	of the test.

2006-05-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_HEADER): Simplify ac_dA and
	ac_dB slightly, to save bytes in the script.
	Max out at 50 lines, rather than 96; this is more likely
	(though not guaranteed) to avoid obscure 'sed' failures.

2006-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): UnixWare `tr' may interpret
	`tr -d -' as bad option argument.  Work around this by deleting
	an unrelated character.
	Report by Tim Rice <tim@multitalents.net>.

2006-05-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>,
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>,
	    Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs): Do not promise that
	we always prefer the GNU version of the program, and that we
	search according to PATH; both rules can have exceptions.
	Update description of AC_PROG_GREP, AC_PROG_EGREP, AC_PROG_FGREP,
	AC_PROG_SED.  Move descriptions of limitations
	to the Limitations of Usual Tools section.
	(Limitations of Usual Tools) <sed>: Mention script length
	limitations with Solaris /usr/ucb/sed.
	<grep>: Fix wording for empty alternative.  Mention that -c and
	-l should not be combined, and that -E and -F should not be
	combined.

2006-05-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_SED): Catch script length
	limits in Solaris 8 /usr/ucb/sed by testing a long script.

2006-05-22  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Defining Symbols): Literal parameter of
	AC_DEFINE is now passed to m4_pattern_allow.
	* NEWS: Mention that; likewise for AC_SUBST.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_DEFINE_TRACE_LITERAL): Pass
	the parameter to m4_pattern_allow.
	* tests/tools.at: Add a check for that.

2006-05-22  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4: Fix typos.

2006-05-21  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_FEATURE_CHECK_LENGTH): Remove
	only the files that this macro generates.

2006-05-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools) <sed>: For
	the HP-UX sed limitation of 99 commands, labels do not count.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_SED_CMD_LIMIT): Mention that
	in the comment.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_HEADER): Revert the change from 2006-05-19.

2006-05-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_GETMNTENT):
	Import the following fix from coreutils:

	2006-01-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Invoke AC_CHECK_FUNCS(getmntent) unconditionally so that tests of
	$ac_cv_func_getmntent (e.g., in gl_LIST_MOUNTED_FILE_SYSTEMS) need
	not double-quote uses of that variable, to accommodate the rare
	case in which getmntent is available in none of the libraries
	checked.  This happens at least on FreeBSD 5.0.

2006-05-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS): Bring back
	ac_config_guess, ac_config_sub, and ac_configure, since evidently
	some other programs unwisely rely on these undocumented vars.
	But put in warning comments about them.
	Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-05/msg00068.html>.
	* NEWS: Document that these variables are intended to go away.

2006-05-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CXX_C_O): Require AC_PROG_CXX,
	and set the language to C++ (analogous to the equivalent Fortran
	tests).

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CXX_C_O): New macro.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (C++ Compiler): Document it.
	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC_C_O): Adjust comment.
	* NEWS: Update.

2006-05-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_HEADER): Fix off-by-one bug
	that caused config.status to generate 100-command sed scripts; the
	portable limit is 99.

2006-05-19  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_MKDIR_P): Name temporary
	variable `ac_d' instead of `d' to avoid infringing namespace.
	Report by Ralf Menzel.

2006-05-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): Don't prepend
	$ac_top_build_prefix to $MKDIR_P if it's just 'mkdir -p'.
	* tests/tools.at (autoconf: subdirectories): New test, taken from
	the corresponding problem report by Ralf Wildenhues in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-05/msg00053.html

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_REPLACE_FNMATCH, AC_FUNC_FNMATCH_GNU):
	Quote some uses of shell variables if they might suffer unexpected
	globbing.  This doesn't fix all instances of quoting problems that
	I found, just the easy ones that look safe.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_SRCDIR, _AC_INIT_HELP):
	(AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR, AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR_DEFAULT, AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS):
	(AC_CANONICAL_BUILD, AC_CANONICAL_HOST, AC_CANONICAL_TARGET):
	(AC_CACHE_LOAD, AC_CACHE_SAVE): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/libs.m4 (_AC_PATH_X_XMKMF, _AC_PATH_X_DIRECT): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/specific.m4 (AC_SYS_LONG_FILE_NAMES): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_LINK, _AC_OUTPUT_SUBDIRS):
	Likewise.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS): Likewise.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_DETECT_BETTER_SHELL): Likewise.

2006-05-18  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* bin/autoreconf.in ($help): Reword according to the manual.
	Suggested by Olly Betts.

2006-05-17  Olly Betts  <olly@survex.com>  (tiny change)
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* bin/autoreconf.in: Pass the directory argument to
	`require_configure_ac'.  Fix comment.
	* tests/torture.at (Configuring subdirectories): Expose this.
	Reported by Olly Betts.

2006-05-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/Automake/Configure_ac.pm, lib/Automake/Channels.pm,
	lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm, lib/Automake/Struct.pm: Sync from
	Automake as follows:

	* lib/Autom4te/Configure_ac.pm (find_configure_ac): Use
	`$configure_in' instead of `configure.in', to preserve
	directory component.

2006-05-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* config/config.guess, config/config.sub, config/texinfo.tex,
	doc/make-stds.texi, doc/standards.texi: Sync from upstream.

2006-05-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/headers.m4 (AC_HEADER_STDBOOL): Fix overly-picky
	test for C99 conformance; (bool) 0.5 is an integer constant
	expression, but (bool) -0.5 is not.  Problem reported by Fedor
	Sergeev in <http://forum.sun.com/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=96202>.

2006-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs): AC_PROG_MKDIR_P now
	sets MKDIR_P, not mkdir_p, to avoid collisions with Automake.
	Warn about obsolete install-sh files.  Remove stray sentence
	fragment and fix cross reference.
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_INSTALL): Don't insist on
	install -d; this undoes the 2006-05-10 change.
	(MKDIR_P): Mark with AN_MAKEVAR.
	(AC_PROG_MKDIR_P): Fall back on $ac_install_sh, not $INSTALL, so
	that we don't require $INSTALL to be thread-safe.  Move comments
	out of generated code.  Require AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR_DEFAULT instead
	of AC_PROG_INSTALL.  Output a message saying that we're checking
	mkdir -p.  Set MKDIR_P rather than mkdir_p.  Do special magic for
	MKDIR_P instead of AC_SUBST.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE, _AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS):
	Special magic for MKDIR_P, too.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_MKDIR_P): Remove comment that defeated
	a dnl.
	* tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_ENV): mkdir_p -> MKDIR_P.

2006-05-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Sync from Automake, as follows:

	2006-05-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>
	* config/install-sh: Initialize IFS, so field splitting isn't
	turned off later.
	* config/mkinstalldirs: Likewise.
	* config/missing: Remove superfluous quotes.  Replace all uses of
	`[' by `test', for consistency, and for..
	* config/missing (sed_minuso, sed_output): New variables.
	(autom4te, help2man, makeinfo): Use them.  Unifies detection of
	`-o FILE', `--output FILE', `--output=FILE', stricter regex.
	Fixes `missing' to detect `--output' for help2man.  Fixes
	PR automake/483.  Report by Dennis J. Linse.
	(autom4te): Document in `missing --help'.

2006-05-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: New macro AC_PROG_MKDIR_P.  AS_MKDIR_P is now more robust.
	* config/install-sh: Don't use 'path' to talk about file names,
	as per GNU coding standards.  Close a race condition reported by Ralf
	Wildenhues and Stepan Kasal.  There is still a race condition
	on hosts that predate Posix 1003.1-1992, but we can't help this.
	Don't mishandle weird characters like space on pre-Posix hosts.
	Invoke mkdir at most once per dir arg on pre-Posix hosts.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Programming in M4sh): Cross-reference to
	AC_PROG_MKDIR_P from AS_MKDIR_P.
	(Limitations of Usual Tools): Cross-reference to AC_PROG_MKDIR_P
	from mkdir.  Mention that Autoconf 2.60 install-sh is safe but
	earlier editions are not (including Automake 1.8.3).
	Do not suggest mkinstalldirs for thread-safety.
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_INSTALL): Insist on an 'install'
	that understands -d, so that AC_PROG_MKDIR_P can fall back on $INSTALL.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_MKDIR_P): Make it more robust in the
	presence of special characters and race conditions.
	* tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_ENV): Add mkdir_p to the list of variables
	in Autoconf's name space.

2006-05-10  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>
	and Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_MKDIR_P): New macro, taken
	from Automake with minor changes.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs): Document AC_PROG_MKDIR_P.

2006-05-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	2006-04-25  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	* lib/install-sh: Simplify the expr implementation of dirname.
	2006-04-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	* lib/install-sh: Handle --, and diagnose unknown options.

2006-05-09  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/Makefile.am (AUTOTEST): Use `$(MY_AUTOM4TE)' instead of
	`./autom4te' to create `./testsuite', since the `all' target
	will ensure its presence, but `installcheck' should not create
	the uninstalled wrappers.

	* tests/torture.at (Unusual Automake input files): Skip if we
	detect automake < 1.8.

2006-05-07  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC_STDC): If ac_cv_prog_cc_stdc
	is set to `no', then that overrides and sets ac_cv_prog_cc_c89
	and ac_cv_prog_cc_c99 to `no', for backward compatibility.
	* NEWS: Update.

2006-05-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_SUBDIRS): Take care not to
	munge (multiple) white space and other oddities.
	* tests/torture.at (AT_CHECK_AC_ARG_VAR): Make sure to M4-escape
	single quotes in variable assignment.
	(AC_ARG_VAR, configure invocation): Adjust tests to expose this
	and similar failures by adding multiple spaces, tabs, and other
	special characters.
	Report and different test suggested by Francesco Romani
	<fromani@gmail.com> and Andrew Church <achurch@achurch.org>.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): When we escape
	single quotes, we only need to search for single quotes; this
	both simplifies the search pattern, and makes us less
	susceptible to `echo' variations for arguments not containing
	single quotes.
	(_AC_ARG_VAR_VALIDATE): Likewise.

2006-05-04  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	overflow.

2006-05-02  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_CANONICAL_SPLIT): Cater for

	first IFS character for assembling `$*'.
	Prompted by a related report from autoconf_bug@nro.ca.

2006-05-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	(Limitations of Usual Tools): Rewrite Mac OS X example for nicer
	output.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Fortran Compiler): Do not use `@ovar' in
	continuous text.

	`action-if-found' -> `action-if-true' and similarly.
	(Obsolete Macros): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_COMPILE_IFELSE): Likewise.
	(AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, AC_TRY_COMPILE, _AC_LINK_IFELSE)
	(AC_LINK_IFELSE, AC_TRY_LINK, AC_COMPILE_CHECK): Likewise.

2006-04-29  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make): Clean up markup.

	* ChangeLog: Typo.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Portable Shell): Allow wrapped URLs, for
	DVI output.

2006-04-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Builtins): Document FreeBSD
	/bin/sh set unsorted output.

	* tests/local.at: Likewise.

2006-04-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	since as_me isn't set yet.

2006-04-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Prepare for deprecation of AS_BASENAME and AS_DIRNAME, and fix
	a few minor bugs in this area.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Programming in M4sh): Comment out the
	documentation of AS_BASENAME, for now.
	(Shell Substitutions): Do not use AS_DIRNAME in an example.
	(Limitations of Builtins) <basename>: Do not refer to
	AS_BASENAME.
	* bin/autoconf.as (me): Don't use AS_BASENAME.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4: Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/headers.m4: Likewise.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Run Time): Document the exit status situation
	with more accuracy and detail.

2006-04-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Introduction): The GNU Autoconf Macro
	Archive is not officially `GNU' any more.  Update URL.

2006-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	some shells (e.g., Solaris 8 /bin/sh) implement it verrrry slowly.
	Instead, just list the shells that we know work.
	* tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_SHELL_SYNTAX): Remove 2nd arg.  All uses
	changed.  Be more cautious about the _cv_ variable.
	* tests/tools.at (Syntax of the shell scripts): Check the
	_cv_ variable once, at first, to avoid an internal autoconf error
	when sh -n does not work.

2006-04-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/Autom4te/FileUtils.pm: Sync from Automake.

2006-04-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_CONFIG_LOG): Don't
	use ">&-" since we're only 99.999% sure that this is portable,
	and since the MinGW bug is fixed in a different way.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Likewise.

2006-04-16  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Handle --recheck
	before opening config.log, to avoid hitting a bug on MinGW.

2006-04-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_CONFIG_LOG): Close
	AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD before reopening it onto the log file.
	This works around a MinGW bug reported by Eric Paire.
	Make sure that all writes to the log file append to it,
	rather than possibly losing data.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Likewise.

2006-04-14  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/Autom4te/FileUtils.pm (find_file): Fix a typo in the
	description.

2006-04-13  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	before the release date in NEWS.

2006-04-12  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	and Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): If the templates for
	the instantiated file do not contain the string 'datarootdir'
	but contain @datadir@, @docdir@, @infodir@, @localedir@, or
	@mandir@, replace the reference '${datarootdir}' by the value.
	* tests/torture.at (datarootdir workaround): New test.
	* NEWS: Advertise this temporary fixup.
	Based on a patch by Bruno Haible, reported and analyzed by
	Paul Eggert and Noah Misch.

2006-04-12  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* tests/autotest.at (Debugging a failed test): Fix comment.

2006-04-12  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_LN_S_PREPARE): Simplify the summary of
	all the changes since 2006-04-07.

2006-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_LN_S_PREPARE): If `ln -s file1 file2'
	succeeded, but `ln -s file dir' failed, take care to remove the
	leftover target before the next test, to prevent its spurious
	failure; also make sure `ln file dir' works before selecting it.
	Thanks to Keith Marshall for pointing this out.
	* THANKS: Update.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Store quoted variable
	assignments in `at_debug_args', so that we put them correctly
	in the `run' script.
	* tests/autotest.at (Debugging a failed test): Unmark XFAIL.
	Reported by Eric Blake.

2006-04-11  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* tests/autotest.at (AT_CHECK_AT): Add new argument, to allow
	top-level tests after micro-suite has been run.   Used in...
	(Debugging a successful test, Debugging script and environment),
	(Debugging a failed test): ...these new tests.  The first of these
	is fixed by...
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (_AT_CREATE_DEBUGGING_SCRIPT): New
	macro, split out from...
	(AT_INIT): ...here, so that using -d also generates a run script.
	Document that -d inhibits top-level logging.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (testsuite Invocation): Document that -d only
	inhibits top-level logging; debug scripts are created.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (_AT_CHECK): Avoid syntax error on empty
	check.
	* tests/autotest.at (Empty test, Empty check): New test to check it.

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_CONST, AC_C_VOLATILE): Avoid warnings
	from gcc.

2006-04-10  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* tests/mktests.sh: Use "trap '' 0", not "trap 0".  Do not touch
	the files if a problem appears.  Make the empty *.at files
	read-only, too.  Proposed by Ralf Wildenhues.

2006-04-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* config/Makefile.am: Add comment to force updated Makefile.in.

	* lib/freeze.mk: Fix typo in comment.  Unlike the last, white
	space only patch to this file, this patch causes the Makefile.in
	files that include freeze.mk to be updated, and thus have a
	newer time stamp again, which in turn makes a pristine CVS
	checkout have correct time stamps.

	* Makefile.maint (cvs-sv): New macro, to be used..
	(config.guess-url_prefix, config.sub-url_prefix)
	(texinfo.tex-url_prefix, standards.texi-url_prefix): ..here;
	point to CVS text checkout of Gnulib files.
	(copyright-check): Bump current year.
	(announcement): Do not hard-wire `./announce-gen'.
	(cvs-update): Propagate failures of `cvs' and `move-if-change'
	correctly.
	* Makefile.cfg (executable-update): Use `chmod a+x' instead of
	`chmod +x'.
	(wget_files): Update config.guess, config.sub, texinfo.tex by
	`wget-update', now that their URLs work again.

2006-04-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Types): Don't use AC_CHECK_TYPE.
	Problem noted by Paul D. Smith.

2006-04-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Remove unused words from word list.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_atoi_atof, .x-sc_space_tab, .x-sc_sun_os_names,
	.x-sc_trailing_space: New files.

	* doc/standards.texi: Sync from gnulib.

	* NEWS, doc/autoconf.texi (AC_LIBOBJ vs LIBOBJS): Mark
	`LIBOBJDIR' as experimental.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_LN_S_PREPARE): MSYS `ln -s' fails
	with a target directory; it's internally implemented as `cp'
	anyway, but since Autoconf advertises the possibility to use
	a target directory when LN_S is `ln -s', we need to find out.
	Reported by Rolf Ebert <rolf.ebert.gcc@gmx.de> against MSYS,
	analyzed by Keith Marshall <keith.marshall@total.com>.

	* THANKS: Update.

2006-04-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Just output
	confdefs.h as-is.  In general, if it has backslash-newline or the
	like, then it doesn't work either to sort or to remove empty
	lines.

2006-04-09  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* tests/Makefile.am (AUTOCONF_FILES): Fix typo in the comment.

2006-04-09  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/autom4te.in (Automake-preselections): Preselect
	_AM_SUBST_NOTMAKE.

2006-04-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Use '\'' for an
	apostrophe within a single-quoted string, as this is the usual
	tradition and is easier to read than '"'"'.  Don't rely on the
	shell treating "$/" like '$/'.  Use a more-consistent indenting
	style for the trap.

2006-04-09  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* tests/autotest.at (Backquote command substitution),
	(Multiline backquote command substitution): Remove mistaken
	AT_NO_CMDSUBST from the 2006-03-14 patch, which was meant to be
	applied...
	(Parenthetical command substitution, Multiline parenthetical
	command substitution): here.

2006-04-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	suggest a #define rather than a typedef for _Bool, and mention
	Gnulib rather than trying to substitute stdbool code.
	(Generic Headers): Add AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE.
	(Generic Declarations): Add AC_CHECK_DECLS_ONCE.
	(Particular Structures): Add AC_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_INO,

	AC_TYPE_UINTMAX_T, AC_TYPE_UINTPTR_T, AC_TYPE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_INT.
	(C Compiler): Move AC_C_LONG_DOUBLE to ...
	(Obsolete Macros): here.  Under AC_LONG_DOUBLE, mention
	AC_TYPE_LONG_DOUBLE or AC_TYPE_LONG_DOUBLE_WIDER instead.
	(Posix Variants): Add AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS.
	(Coding Style).  Don't mention m4_expand_once.
	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_LONG_DOUBLE): Implement via

	New macros.

	* tests/mktests.sh (ac_exclude_list, au_exclude_list): Do not
	use /^foo|bar$/, it does not mean /^(foo|bar)$/.

2006-04-08  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Fix the wording
	of the warning introduced by the 2001-08-28 change.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_CACHE_SAVE): All `ac_cv_env_foo'
	variables shall be overriden by the cache.
	* tests/torture.at (AC_ARG_VAR): Test also with a first value
	that contains braces.

2006-04-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	Revert the patch from 2006-04-01 and only improve
	_AS_DETECT_BETTER_SHELL:

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_PATH_WALK): Do not optimize; do not
	skip nonexistent directories.
	(_AS_DETECT_BETTER_SHELL): The optimization is moved here--try
	only shell candidates which exist.
	(AS_UNAME): No need to give three parameters to _AS_PATH_WALK.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): No need to give three
	parameters to _AS_PATH_WALK.

2006-04-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>,
	    Ralf Wildenhues <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* bin/autoupdate.in (handle_autoconf_patches): Change the way we
	distinguish m4sugar macros.
	* tests/tools.at (autoupdating with aclocal and m4_include):
	New test.  Bug reported by Gary V. Vaughan <gary@gnu.org>,
	test case by Noah Misch <noah@cs.caltech.edu>.

2006-04-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	Revert my change from 2006-03-17, in other words:

	    Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>,
	    Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>,
	    Ralf Wildenhues <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_CACHE_DUMP): Fix the detection of
	whether `set' quotes correctly: redirect stderr of the tested
	`set', and use a subshell, for Ultrix; use `sed' instead of
	`grep' for zsh `set' which may write binary output; match only
	at the beginning of a line, to avoid false positives.
	In order to avoid false positives by unrelated variables with
	multiline content, put the dump algorithm in a subshell and
	unset all variables containing newlines (except some which are
	special to the shell).  Warn about cache variables that are
	unset.

	(AC_LINK_FILES): Obsoleted since (and thus AU_DEFUN'ed).

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Shell Substitutions): Mention the MSYS
	shell issue with double-quoted command substitutions of native
	commands.
	Reported to MSYS by Mark Cave-Ayland, to Autoconf by Keith
	Marshall.

	(AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS): Do not do so here.
	(_AC_CONFIG_REGISTER_DEST): Double quote the tags in macros _AC_LIST_TAGS
	  and_AC_LIST_TAG_COMMANDS; fixes another regression introduced by the
	  2005-07-25 rewrite.  Noticed by Noah Misch.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_PRESERVE_HELP_ORDER): Do not define
	  _AC_PRESERVE_HELP_ORDER, ...
	(AC_ARG_ENABLE, AC_ARG_WITH): ... use AC_PROVIDE_IFELSE insetad.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_ARG_VAR): Do not use m4_divert_once
	  inside m4_expand_once; it is redundant.

	  for --help from Cygnus `configure.'

2006-04-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	lib/autoconf/specific.m4, lib/autoconf/status.m4,
	lib/autoconf/types.m4, lib/autotest/general.m4,
	tests/mktests.sh, tests/torture.at: White space cleanup:
	remove some SPACE before TAB, or add quoting ('' or @&t@).

	* NEWS, TODO, bin/autoreconf.in: `filesystem' -> `file system'.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Shell Substitutions): Document `^' vs. `|'.

2006-04-05  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Prep AT_*_all, so that an
	empty test suite works.

	(AC_CONFIG_FILES, AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, AC_CONFIG_LINKS): Do so here.
	(AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS): Append NAME to ac_config_commands without
	normalizing it, consistent it with previous releases.
	* tests/torture.at (Macro calls in AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS tags): New test.

2006-04-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_BASENAME_EXPR, AS_DIRNAME_EXPR):
	Use simplified args that Eric Blake originally suggested.

2006-04-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/mktests.sh: Don't use 'cat'; just read the files directly.
	Prefer 'sort -u' to 'sort | uniq'.  Filter data before sorting it.
	Use 'comm' rather than N instances of grep; this also fixes a bug
	whereby substrings were incorrectly matched, causing us to not
	generate tests for AC_F77_NAME_MANGLING and AC_FUNC_LSTAT.
	(exclude_list): Exclude empty macros.
	(ac_exclude_list): Exclude AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULT.

	Use awk rather than grep -E or egrep, to avoid
	portability problems with regular expressions containing newlines.
	(exclude_list, ac_exclude_list, au_exclude_list, ac_exclude_script):
	Switch from grep to awk syntax.
	(ac_exclude_script): Renamed from ac_exclude_egrep.

	typedef'ed restricted pointer, to catch a compiler bug on
	HP-UX 11.x, and fix warnings so it passes with -Werror.
	(_AC_PROG_CC_C99): Likewise.
	Reported by Albert Chin <china@thewrittenword.com>.
	* tests/mktests.sh: Do not skip AC_C_INLINE, AC_C_RESTRICT.

2006-04-03  Noah Misch  <noah@cs.caltech.edu>

	* bin/autoscan.in (subdirs): New global.
	(scan_file): Prune directories with configure{,.{ac,in,gnu}}.

	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT): Don't try to
	  detect exeext, it will be done by _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_O; just set
	  ac_file to the name of the default output file and call
	  _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_WORKS.  Move the definition of ac_files and the
	  initial `rm' of the candidate files...
	(_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT): ... here and simplify them.  Moreover, use
	  the same list in subsequent `rm' calls, and for the temporary

2005-07-25  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	Rewrite substantial part of lib/autoconf/status.m4.
	The main change is that CONFIG_FILES, CONFIG_HEADERS, CONFIG_LINKS,
	and CONFIG_COMMANDS are not processed in four separate loops.
	Instead, there is one main loop.  This alows that the common code
	is expanded only once, thus config.status (and configure) is smaller.

	The registration mechnism in AC_CONFIG_FILES and cousins also changed;
	the AC_LIST_FILES and cousins macros are no longer used.

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES, _AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS,
	_AC_OUTPUT_LINKS, _AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS): Renamed to ...
	(_AC_OUTPUT_FILE, _AC_OUTPUT_HEADER, _AC_OUTPUT_LINK,
	_AC_OUTPUT_COMMAND): ..., respectively.  These macros no longer
	contain the initialization, nor the for loop, nor the associated
	commands; all these go to ...
	(_AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP): ... this new macro, called from
	_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS.
	(_AC_CONFIG_SPLIT, _AC_CONFIG_SPLIT_SOURCE_DEST, _AC_CONFIG_SPLIT_FILE_IN):
	Nuked; the code was merged into _AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP.
	(_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): The creation of the sed script ...
	(AC_OUTPUT): ... and the setup of ac_vpsub goes to ...
	(_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): ... a new macro, also called from
	_AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP.
	(_AC_CONFIG_FILES, _AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, _AC_CONFIG_LINKS,
	_AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS): Use ...

	(AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS_PRE, AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS_PRE,

	parameter to AC_DIAGNOSE.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS): Likewise.

	  a loop to assign all ac_env_* and ac_cv_env_* variables.
	(_AC_ARG_VAR_VALIDATE): Use shell variable ac_precious_vars, divert
	  to INIT_PREPARE.
	(_AC_INIT_DEFAULTS): At the end, if _AC_PRECIOUS_VARS is set, assign
	  its value to shell variable ac_precious_vars and call
	  _AC_ARG_VAR_STORE and _AC_ARG_VAR_VALIDATE.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Don't call
	  _AC_ARG_VAR_VALIDATE.

	addition.

2005-06-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	to update the man page.  That way, we don't have to check in new
	man pages every month.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_VAR_TEST_SET): Work even if $1 contains
	quotes and backslashes.  Patch from Derek Price.

	redefined M4 macros to this node.  Document m4_include & m4_sinclude.

	Use @example.org in email addresses when the examples
	might get inadvertently cut-and-pasted into user code.

2005-06-06  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	m4_cdr of one-member list was [[]] (one-member list containing an
	empty string) instead of [] (an empty list.  Callers were skewed to
	match this misbehaviour.  As a consequence of this:
	 - m4_foreach([x], [], [foo]) expanded to `foo', while
	 - the expansion of m4_foreach([x], [[]], [foo]) was empty.
	This bug has been fixed:

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_cdr): If only one argument is given,
	  expand to an empty string; print error msg if called without
	  an argument list.
	(m4_foreach, m4_map, m4_map_sep): Don't expect the previous
	  misbehaviour; handle [] and [[]] correctly.

	  parse the long line.

2005-06-04  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

2005-05-31  Dan Manthey  <dan_manthey@partech.com>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES): Output variables may
	now contain newlines, and substituted files must be referenced on

	commands can be put in a sed script portably.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Setting Output Variables): Document above

	  argument to m4_foreach.  I guess it was necessary in the past,
	  but I think it's a no-op now.

2005-05-17  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_HELP): Merge two consecutive
	  ``cat <<_ACEOF'' commands to one.
	(_AC_CANONICAL_SPLIT): Use expr, not ``echo|sed.''
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4: On various places, use expr instead of
	  ``echo|sed.''
	(_AC_CONFIG_SPLIT, _AC_CONFIG_SPLIT_SOURCE_DEST):
	(_AC_CONFIG_SPLIT_FILE_IN): New macros, to factor out common code.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Use expr to get the numbers from
	  a range.
	* tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_SHELL_SYNTAX): Use awk to search for
	  the wrong patterns between ``case'' and ``esac.''  The previous
	  code had false positives.

2005-05-14  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (_AC_LIBOBJ_ALLOCA): Prepend ${LIBOBJDIR},
	as on 2005-05-02.

2005-05-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Autoconf Language): Be more precise about
	quoting rules.  Problems noted by Stepan Kasal.
	Also, throughout this document, be more careful about white space.
	"blank", "white space", and "space" all have different meanings
	and we should be careful to say what we mean.

2005-05-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix C++ related problems reported by Werner Lemberg.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (C++ Compiler): Mention .cpp extension.
	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_LANG(C++)): Set ac_ext to .cpp, not .cc.

2005-05-05  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Generic Functions): Typos.

2005-05-02  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_LIBOBJS_NORMALIZE): Prepend each
	object named in LIBOBJS and LTLIBOBJS with the ${LIBOBJDIR}, as
	set by latest automake.

2005-05-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): "expr '' \| ''"
	outputs 0 on GNU/Linux these days.

2005-04-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Autoconf Language): Add more description
	about quoting heuristics.

2005-04-29  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_KEYWORDS): Separate by space,
	not newline.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (External Software): Replace AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED
	by AC_DEFINE; it was a mistake.
	From bug reported against libtool by Dalibor Topic <robilad@kaffe.org>.

2005-04-25  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS): A tiny optimization.

2005-04-22  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (External Software): Quadrigraphs are not
	  processed correctly in AS_HELP_STRING; avoid this in the examples.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_HELP_STRING): Add a FIXME about quadrigraphs.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_text_wrap): Likewise; and rephrase the
	  comment and reduce m4_default([foo], []) to [foo].
	(m4_strip): Update the explanation.

2005-04-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE, _AC_RUN_IFELSE):
	Remove core.conftest.* too; it's generated by Tru64 5.1.
	Problem reported by Jennis Pruett.
	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4
	(AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED, AC_FUNC_UTIME_NULL):
	Don't bother to remove core files; AC_RUN_IFELSE should do that
	for you.

2005-04-19  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_bpatsubsts): Add the b- to comment, too.

	fails if %s isn't supported.  Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

2005-03-22  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_FC_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS):
	Merge `-z option' as well for the benefit of Solaris link flags.  Pass
	whole-archive (-zallextract, -zdefaultextract) options in the hope of
	unique libraries, for the Sun Fortran 95 8.0 compiler.  Bug reported
	against Libtool by Yury Puhalsky <pooh@cryptopro.ru>.

2005-03-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: The configure command now warns you if you attempt to use
	a directory whose name contains a special character like space,
	newline, or "\".
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Installation Directory Variables): Allow
	"," in file names.  Do not use \@; it's not a portable regexp.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_DIRCHECK): New macro.
	(AC_INIT): Use it.
	(_AC_INIT_SRCDIR): Use ac_pwd rather than invoking pwd.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Propagate
	ac_pwd, and quote srcdir.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Quote file name args.

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Fix some systematic formatting problems.
	".)"  needs a following @: if not at the end of a sentence, and
	similarly for "!)".  "etc." should be preceded by a comma.
	"n-th" -> "@var{n}th".  pdksh is still buggy, so update its date.

2005-03-22  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Input): Mention that AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR's
	argument is often called 'build-aux'.

2005-03-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Quotation Rule Of Thumb): Mention that the
	  macro AC_TRY_LINK is obsolete.
	(Installation Directory Variables): Change `AC_OUTPUT_FILES' to
	  `AC_CONFIG_FILES'.

2005-02-24  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC): Be more careful to skip
	  `/usr/ucb/cc'; use `cl.exe' to distinguish the MS compiler
	  from a Common Lisp's `cl'.
	(AC_PROG_CXX): Behave according to the documentation: don't
	  search for $ac_tool_prefix$CCC and $CCC, just set CXX=$CCC;
	  make the variable CCC precious; use `cl.exe', not `cl'.

2005-02-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	    Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_DEFAULTS): Redirect stdin from
	/dev/null, as "configure" shouldn't read stdin, and this insulates
	us from problems (e.g., when testing for "cl").  Also, do this
	redirection before invoking "hostname" or "uname", and keep the
	original input stream available via...
	(AS_ORIGINAL_STDIN_FD): ... this new macro.
	(_AC_PREPROC_IFELSE, _AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, _AC_LINK_IFELSE): Don't
	bother with "</dev/null" since it's now done at the top of
	'configure'.
	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC, AC_PROG_CXX): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_PATH_PROG_FLAVOR_GNU): Likewise.

	(Printing Messages): Mention it.
	* tests/base.at (Input/Output): New test.

2005-02-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_ECHO_N_PREPARE): Don't set ECHO_C to
	newline if neither \c nor -n work, as that would output two
	newlines.  Prefer -n to \c.  Reported by Stepan Kasal.

2005-02-12  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_IF): Define by m4_defun, not m4_define.
	This causes that any required macros inside will get before the if.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (autom4te.cache): A typo.

2005-02-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Undo previous change, except keep the change to
	lib/autoconf/programs.m4 that replaced grep with shell
	pattern-matching.  This is because net-snmp configure reads stdin.
	Reported by Noah Misch.

2005-02-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_DEFAULTS): Redirect stdin
	from /dev/null, as "configure" shouldn't read stdin, and this
	insulates us from problems (e.g., when testing for "cl").
	Suggested by Alexandre Duret-Lutz.  Also, do this redirection
	before invoking "hostname" or "uname".
	(_AC_PREPROC_IFELSE, _AC_COMPILE_IFELSE,
	_AC_LINK_IFELSE): Undo previous change, as it's no longer needed.
	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC, AC_PROG_CXX): Don't bother with
	"</dev/null" since it's now done at the top of 'configure'.
	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_PATH_PROG_FLAVOR_GNU): Likewise.
	Also, replace grep with shell pattern-matching, to save a process.

2005-02-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_PREPROC_IFELSE, _AC_COMPILE_IFELSE,
	_AC_LINK_IFELSE): Redirect stdin to /dev/null, in an attempt to
	avoid thinking that Allegro Common Lisp's "cl" command is a C++
	compiler.

2005-02-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Document that
	grep -q isn't portable.  Improve grep -s explanation.
	Problem reported by Dan Manthey.

2005-02-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Shell Variables): Clarify
	PATH_SEPARATOR wording; fix typo in IFS.  Reported by Gary V. Vaughan.

2005-02-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Use @acronym for DJGPP.
	Fix some @code's that should have been @env's, and vice versa.
	Sort environment variable names.
	Mention that shells no longer inherit IFS.
	Don't recommend PATH_SEPARATOR=';' so strongly.
	Mention that $RANDOM might expand to the empty string.
	"symlink" and "soft link" -> "symbolic link".
	Improve mktemp description (reported by Bruno Haible).

2005-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/foreign.at (Libtool): Don't overquote AT_SETUP arg.
	* tests/m4sh.at (AS_DIRNAME, AS_BASENAME, AS_MKDIR_P, AS_HELP_STRING):
	Likewise.
	* tests/semantics.at (AC_C_BIGENDIAN, AC_PATH_PROG & AC_PATH_PROGS):
	Likewise.

2005-02-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention AT_COPYRIGHT.

	* tests/local.at (AT_CMP): Use diff directly on input files rather
	than copying them.

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_SED): Don't look in
	/usr/xpg4/bin since that sed dumps core (at least on Solaris 8).

2005-02-04  Noah Misch  <noah@cs.caltech.edu>
	and Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/autotest.at (Empty test suite): New test.
	* tests/torture.at (Substitute and define special characters)
	(Substitute a 2000-byte string, Define to a 2000-byte string)
	(Substitute a newline, Define a newline): New tests.

2005-02-04  Noah Misch  <noah@cs.caltech.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_re_string, m4_re_word): Revert 2002-03-04.

	* tests/m4sugar.at (AT_CHECK_M4SUGAR_TEXT, AT_CHECK_M4RE): New macros.
	(Standard regular expressions): New test.
	(m4_warn, m4_require: circular dependencies, m4_text_wrap): Strip
	excess test name quoting.
	* tests/semantics.at (AC_CHECK_HEADERS_OLD, AC_CHECK_HEADERS_NEW): Pass
	CPPFLAGS to `configure' instead of setting it in `configure'.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_UNAME): Try only /usr/bin/hostinfo, not
	any `hostinfo' in $PATH, since hostinfo.exe is a popular file name
	on some platforms.

	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (AC_LANG(Fortran), AC_FC_SRCEXT):
	s/FC_SRCEXT/ac_fc_srcext/; s/FCFLAGS_SRCEXT/ac_fcflags_srcext/.

	* tests/local.at (AT_CMP): New macro.
	(AT_DATA_AUTOCONF): Do not call AC_PROG_GREP.
	(AC_SAVE_STATE): Move environment grep...

	* tests/c.at (Extensions): Do not exit early.
	* tests/atlocal.in: Inherit $GREP.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Writing testsuite.at): Document AT_COPYRIGHT.

2005-02-04  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>
	and Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): New mkstemp entry.

2005-02-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_re_escape): Escape ?, ^, \, $ too;
	this fixes a bug tickled by the AT_CAPTURE_FILE change noted below.

	Try not to generated lines of unlimited length, as POSIX places a
	2047-byte limit on line length of portable text files.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_SUBST, AC_SUBST_FILE):
	Use newline as a separator, not space.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_TESTED, AT_KEYWORDS): Likewise.
	(AT_CAPTURE_FILE): Use space-backslash-newline as a separator, not
	space.

2005-02-03  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_SHELL_FN_WORK): Move func_* to
	as_func_*.  Add test to check whether positional parameters
	are restored after function return.

2005-02-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Shell Variables): Mention _,
	BIN_SH, DUALCASE.  Say that variables other than "status" are safe
	if they contain a lower-case letter.  The DUALCASE problem was
	reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

	* bin/autoconf.as: Don't exit with status 0 after write failure
	with --help or --version.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_HELP, _AC_INIT_VERSION): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Likewise.

2005-02-02  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools):
	Unicos 9 sed limitations.
	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC): Try cf77 before fort77
	to get the option-enhanced interface on older Crays.  Try ftn for
	Fortran 95 (newer Crays).

2005-02-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Go back to the simple solution, but take
	care to echo the commands, so the user knows what's going on.
	Modified from a suggestion by Stepan Kasal.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (autoreconf Invocation): Mention autopoint,
	with a cross reference.  Derived from a suggestion by Bruce Korb.

2005-01-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (config.status Invocation): Warn about
	discrepancy between CONFIG_SHELL and shell used to invoke 'configure'.
	* doc/install.texi (Defining Variables): Likewise.
	Based on a proposed patch by Ralf Wildenhues.

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Make sure the required generated files
	are up to date.  Problem and original solution proposed by Stepan Kasal.
	$(dist_man_MANS:.1=-bin-prereq), $(dist_man_MANS:.1=-tests-prereq),
	implicit-man-prerequisites): New rules, used by the above.

	* doc/make-stds.texi, doc/standards.texi: Sync from gnulib.
	* config/config.guess, config/config.sub, config/install-sh: Likewise.
	* config/missing, config/texinfo.tex: Likewise.

2005-01-29  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	Simplify the implementation of m4_require (a.k.a. AC_REQUIRE).
	Update the long comment explaining it.

	m4_require no longer writes an ``is required by'' line to the
	execution stack.  It contains only one bit of non-redundant
	information: that the macro was required, not called.  And even
	this bit is useless in most situations: have you ever met a macro
	which both calls and requires the same macro?

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (_m4_defun_pro): Don't push a diversion...
	(_m4_defun_pro_outer): ... only via this macro, for the outermost
	  macro.
	(_m4_defun_epi, _m4_defun_epi_outer): Complementarily.
	(m4_expansion_stack_pop): Remove the misplaced comment.
	(m4_require): Don't put the ``is required by'' line to the
	  execution stack; slightly improve the out-of-a-defun error message.
	(_m4_divert_grow): New macro, counter for the temporary diversions.
	(_m4_require_call): Use it.

2004-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/libs.m4 (_AC_PATH_X_XMKMF): If xmkmf returns
	"/usr/include", clear ac_x_includes instead of leaving it as "no"

2004-09-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Give AC_DEFINE and AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED
	three args in examples.  Problem reported by Frederik Fouvry in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2004-09/msg00017.html
	Also, fix some minor spacing and punctuation bugs.

2004-09-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* Makefile.cfg (wget_files): Remove config.guess, config.sub,
	texinfo.tex for now (done by hand now).
	* Makefile.maint (wget_files, cvs_files):
	Remove ansi2knr.c; nobody uses it.
	(ansi2knr.c-url_prefix): Remove.
	(cvs-update): Fix test for failure.  I don't know why it ever
	worked...

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Update URLs, some of which went stale.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS): Have configure
	handle "--" as per POSIX.  Suggested by Paul Pogonyshev.

	* config/config.guess, config/config.sub, config/elisp-comp,
	config/install-sh, config/mkinstalldirs, config/texinfo.tex,
	doc/fdl.texi, doc/standards.texi: Sync with master copy.

2004-08-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_LANG_BOOL_COMPILE_TRY(C),
	AC_C_LONG_DOUBLE): Undo 2004-06-04 change, as it didn't work with
	HP-UX 11.23 cc/aCC or Tru64 4.0 cc.  Problem reported by Noah Misch in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2004-07/msg00004.html>.

	More fixes to support spaces in the name of the build directory.
	This isn't a complete fix but it's an improvement.

	* bin/autoconf.as (autom4te_options): New var.
	Use it instead of appending to AUTOM4TE, so that we can allow
	spaces in the build directory's absolute name.
	* bin/autoheader.in ($autoconf): Allow spaces in file names.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT, AT_CLEANUP, _AT_CHECK,
	AT_CHECK_NOESCAPE): Likewise.
	* tests/wrapper.as (testdir, AUTOM4TE_CFG, autom4te_perllibdir,

2004-08-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Function Portability): Document isinf and
	and isnan.  From a suggestion by Kevin Ryde.

	* lib/Autom4te/General.pm (END): Return correct exit status even
	if unlink succeeds and sets $?.  Needed with Solaris 8's perl 5.00503.

2004-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/torture.at (Deep Package): Use configure.in, not configure.ac,
	for compatibility with Automake 1.4.  Reported by J C Fitzgerald in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2003-08/msg00051.html>.

2004-08-04  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_REQUIRE_AUX_FILE): New empty macro.
	(AC_CANONICAL_BUILD): Call it to require config.sub and config.guess.
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_INSTALL): Likewise for install-sh.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Input): Document AC_REQUIRE_AUX_FILE.
	* lib/autom4te.in (Automake-preselections): Preselect
	AC_REQUIRE_AUX_FILE.  Automake 1.10 will trace it.

2004-08-02  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/autom4te.in (Automake-preselections): Preselect
	AC_CANONICAL_BUILD and AC_CANONICAL_TARGET.  Automake 1.9.1 will
	trace them.

2004-07-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_BOURNE_COMPATIBLE): Set BIN_SH, for

2004-07-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_BOURNE_COMPATIBLE): Use "set -o posix"
	with pdksh, too.  Problem reported by Patrick Welche via
	Gary V. Vaughan.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Shellology): Note that set -o posix is
	useful for pkdsh, too.

2004-06-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_DETECT_BETTER_SHELL): Require
	_AS_UNSET_PREPARE, so that we can use $as_unset directly.
	Don't fail if ENV or BASH_ENV is readonly.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_BOURNE_COMPATIBLE): If the shell is
	zsh, disable GLOB_SUBST to avoid backslash handling problems.
	(trivial change)

2004-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (File System Conventions): Warn about
	names like "aux".  Problem reported by Eric Blake.

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_LANG_BOOL_COMPILE_TRY (C)): Use division
	by zero instead of array size, so that we can use any arithmetic
	constant expression (instead of requiring an integer constant
	expression).  This allows us to test expressions like DBL_MAX <
	LDBL_MAX, which didn't conform to the C standard using the old
	method.
	(AC_C_LONG_DOUBLE): Put back in the tests for LDBL_MAX and LDBL_EPSILON,
	now that we can do floating-point tests at compile time.

2004-06-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_LONG_DOUBLE): Don't check LDBL_MAX
	and LDBL_EPSILON, as the resulting expression isn't an
	integer constant expression and violates the C standard.
	Problem reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.  Also, check
	for "L" suffix, and check that long double doesn't have
	worse range or precision than double, that mixed-mode
	arithmetic doesn't generate a diagnostic, that double
	constants fit in long double.

2004-06-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Function Portability): Add notes on free(NULL),
	malloc(0) and realloc(NULL,size).

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Shell Substitutions): Spelling error reported by
	Bob Proulx.

2004-05-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/autoconf/headers.m4 (HAVE_STDBOOL_H): Detect _Bool bug
	in HP aC++/ANSI C B3910B A.05.55 [Dec 04 2003].  Problem reported
	by Jim Meyering.

2004-05-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Builtins): Mention that ! COMMAND

2004-05-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (testsuite Scripts): Fix typo.
	Problem reported by Stepan Kasal.

2004-05-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/Makefile.am (autoconfdir): Fix to match comment (trivial
	change).  Patch reported by Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2004-05/msg00092.html>.

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_MBRTOWC): Don't assume that a
	function F exists if the compiler and linker let you compile an
	expression like (F != 0).  Recent versions of GCC optimize away
	the reference to F in that case, since every function address must
	be nonzero, so the link succeeds even if F does not exist.
	Problem reported by Manu in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2004-05/msg00060.html>.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Systemology): Standardize on the spelling of
	"Unix".  Many uses changed.
	(Limitations of Builtins): Explain better why the ! command isn't
	portable.

2004-05-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/autom4te.in (Automake-preselections): Preselect
	LT_SUPPORTED_TAG in lieu of AC_LIBTOOL_TAGS.

	referencing AC_FUNC_STRERROR_R.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Functions): In AC_FUNC_CLOSEDIR_VOID,
	note pessimistic assumption when cross compiling.

2004-05-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make): Note that BSD make
	(until 2004) invoked subcommands with sh -e, contra POSIX.
	Reported by Kevin Ryde.

2004-05-10  Eric Sunshine  <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

	* programs.m4 (_AC_PROG_GREP): Fixed bug where PATH argument handed to
	_AC_PATH_PROG_FEATURE_CHECK contained leading whitespace (i.e.
	"        $PATH:/usr/xpg4/bin"). This resulted in bogus tests, such as
	`test -f "        /usr/bin/grep"', which _always_ failed.
	(AC_PROG_SED): Ditto bogus PATH fix.
	* autoconf.texi (AC_PROG_GREP): Properly document that this macro
	requires that grep correctly supports _multiple_ `-e' options, rather
	than stating only that grep should accept `-e'.

2004-05-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port to C99, which requires that 'exit' be declared.

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_BIGENDIAN): Use AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULT
	to ensure that stdlib.h is included.
	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (_AC_LIBOBJ_ALLOCA, AC_FUNC_SETPGRP,
	AC_FUNC_STRTOD, AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED, AC_FUNC_FORK, _AC_FUNC_FORK,
	_AC_FUNC_VFORK, AC_FUNC_WAIT3): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/specific.m4 (AC_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (AC_TYPE_GETGROUPS): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/headers.m4 (AC_HEADER_STDC): Include <stdlib.h>
	when using 'exit' in a test; C99 requires that 'exit' be declared.

2004-05-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs): AC_PROG_GREP
	now prefers 'grep' implementations that accept -e.
	(Limitations of Usual Tools): Describe problems of traditional
	egrep and fgrep with long input lines, and of traditional grep
	with -e.
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_GREP): Check for -e, too.
	(_AC_PROG_GREP): Assume 3rd arg is properly quoted for the shell.
	All callers changed.  Append /usr/xpg4/bin to the PATH, for
	Solaris.
	(_AC_FEATURE_CHECK_LENGTH): Discard stderr, so we don't bother
	the user with complaints about multiple -e options.
	* tests/local.at (AC_STATE_SAVE): Use $GREP, not grep.
	Define it with AC_PROG_GREP.
	* configure.ac (AC_PROG_GREP): Add.
	* lib/freeze.mk (GREP): New macro.

2004-05-02  Eric Sunshine  <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_DETECT_BETTER_SHELL): Consult $SHELL as
	a possible candidate only after all others fail, rather than
	consulting it first.  This improves backward compatibility by
	better reflecting the way shell selection occurred in previous
	versions of Autoconf, and should help to avoid triggering latent
	problems in other packages, such as the one in Automake where zsh
	is not handled robustly:
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2004-04/msg00095.html
	Although it is not Autoconf's responsibility to work around
	problems in Automake, it nevertheless makes sense to avoid
	introducing unnecessary incompatibilites.

2004-04-22  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>,
	    Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_FEATURE_CHECK_LENGTH): Don't guess
	how deeply nested we are when a suitable tool is found, set the
	ac_path_TOOL_found flag.
	(_AC_PATH_PROG_FEATURE_CHECK): Encapsulate knowledge of how deeply
	nested we are in this macro.  Break out of all 3 nested loops if
	ac_path_TOOL_found is set.

2004-04-21  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_FEATURE_CHECK_LENGTH): Break out
	of the _AS_PATH_WALK loop too if GNU flavor is found.

2004-04-21  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make): Update documentation
	for `$<'.  New entry `Long lines', based on a report from Simon
	Josefsson.  Augment the documentation for SHELL = @SHELL@ with a
	paragraph about DJGPP, based on a mail from Richard Dawe.

2004-04-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/c.at (C keywords): Don't assume that GCC supports
	"restrict" and "inline", as sufficiently-old GCC versions do not
	(also, GCC configured to be in pedantic C89 mode does not).
	Problem reported by Sumit Pandya in:
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2004-04/msg00092.html

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (_AC_PROG_CC_G, _AC_PROG_CXX_G): Don't
	consider -g to work if it generates warnings when plain compiles
	don't.  Problem reported by Braden McDaniel in:
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2003-07/msg00014.html

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Slashes): New section, to document a problem
	reported by Jim Meyering in:
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-02/msg00060.html

	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT): Remove potential
	linker output files before linking, to work around IRIX 6 linker bug.
	Problem reported by Rainer Orth in:
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2004-02/msg00007.html

2004-04-20  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_FEATURE_CHECK_LENGTH): Make the
	best tool so far counter rely on the tool path variable name to
	avoid checks for one tool being affected by the results of running
	the length check on a previous tool.

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_PROG_GREP): Take an additional
	match expression argument, as different greps have different
	regular expression flavours.
	(AC_PROG_FGREP): Pass 'FGREP'. fgrep treats all match chars as
	literals.
	(AC_PROG_EGREP): Pass 'EGREP$'.
	(AC_PROG_GREP): Pass 'GREP$'.

2004-04-20  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_GREP): Cache variable
	is `ac_cv_path_GREP', not `oc_cv_path_GREP'.

2004-03-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Headers, Particular Types, Generic
	Types, Specific Compiler Characteristics, System Services,
	Obsolete Macros): Use 'long int', 'short int', 'unsigned int'
	etc. consistently instead of 'long', 'short', 'unsigned' etc.
	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_LANG_INT_SAVE(C), AC_C_BIGENDIAN): Likewise.
	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_MMAP, AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES):
	Likewise.

	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (AC_TYPE_GETGROUPS, AC_TYPE_SIZE_T,
	AC_TYPE_OFF_T): Likewise.
	* tests/semantics.at (AC_CHECK_TYPES: backward compatibility):
	Likewise.

	* tests/foreign.at (Libtool): Create an empty aclocal.m4, to
	pacify libtool 1.5.2.  Fix quoting problems in sed command.

2004-03-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Structures): AC_STRUCT_TIMEZONE
	now defines HAVE_DECL_TZNAME if it is declared, when
	HAVE_STRUCT_TM_TM_ZONE is not defined.
	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (AC_STRUCT_TIMEZONE): Implement this.
	Do not assume atoi.  Rely on HAVE_DECL_TZNAME when testing
	for HAVE_TZNAME.

2004-03-28  Steven G. Johnson  <stevenj@fftw.org>

	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC_V_OUTPUT): Corrected
	superfluous backslashing of quotes (") in sed expressions;
	thanks to Paul Eggert.

2004-03-26  Steven G. Johnson  <stevenj@alum.mit.edu>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Specifying Names): Move cross_compiling ovindex to
	(Run Time): ... here, where it's now mentioned.

2004-03-19  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (autom4te Invocation): Language Autoconf
	inherits from language Autoconf-without-aclocal-m4.
	(Customizing autom4te): Adjust example; the cache must now be
	disabled for language Autoconf-without-aclocal-m4.

2004-03-16  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>
	    Nathanael Nerode  <neroden@twcny.rr.com>

	(Specifying Names): Document the reason for these future
	behavioral changes.
	* tests/mktests.sh: Do not generate tests for the
	new macros.
	* NEWS: Document these changes.

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Avoid macros with unbraced arguments,
	they make TeX hang up.

2004-03-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@bogus.example.com>

	* NEWS: New macro AC_CHECK_ALIGNOF.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Generic Compiler Characteristics): Document it.
	* lib/autoconf/types.m4 (AC_CHECK_SIZEOF): Use long int rather than
	int; avoid "a `$1'" since this isn't grammatical if $1 begins with a
	vowel.
	(AC_CHECK_ALIGNOF): New macro.
	* tests/mktests.sh (ac_exclude_list): Exclude AC_CHECK_ALIGNOF.
	* tests/semantics.at (AC_CHECK_ALIGNOF): Add tests similar to

2004-02-20  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools) <mkdir>: `mkdir -p'
	is not always thread-safe.  Report from Nathanael Nerode.

2004-02-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix a dependencies problem, stemming from a Autoconf 2.59 build
	problem on QNX reported by Stephen Rasku in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2004-02/msg00066.html>.

	* bin/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/autoconf.in): Depend on
	$(m4sh_m4f_dependencies); this removes a FIXME.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/wrapper.in): Likewise.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Split into pieces,
	one per related section.  Add $(srcdir)/wrapper.in.

2004-02-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Setting Output Variables): Emphasize that
	AC_SUBST provides no portable way to escape literal newlines.

	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_FC_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS): Ignore all

2004-01-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	HAVE_INTTYPES_H is defined.  This is needed on Tru64 5.1b with
	Compac C V6.5-207 (dtk), which defines uintmax_t in <stdint.h> but
	not <inttypes.h>.  Problem reported by Tim Mooney in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-01/msg00147.html>.

	Likewise.

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_SED): Use diff, not sed;

2004-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (_AC_PROG_CC_STDC): Try -std, not -std1, since
	-std1 disables some useful extensions on Tru64.  Problem reported
	by N. Lichtmaier in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2004-01/msg00100.html>.

	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2004-01/msg00000.html
	(_AC_COMPUTE_INT_COMPILE): Invoke _AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, not
	AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, since we now assume our caller invokes
	AC_LANG_COMPILER_REQUIRE, for symmetry with _AC_COMPUTE_INT_RUN.
	(_AC_COMPUTE_INT_RUN): Likewise, for _AC_RUN_IFELSE instead
	of AC_RUN_IFELSE; this avoids the warning mentioned above.
	(_AC_COMPUTE_INT): Invoke AC_LANG_COMPILER_REQUIRE.

2004-01-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_LIBOBJS_NORMALIZE): Avoid \$ inside
	`"'...'"`, as it's confusing (and I suspect it may not work on

2004-01-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Mention that cc
	-c -o might not work.  From a suggestion by Kevin Ryde.
	(C Compiler, Generating Sources, Limitations
	of Usual Tools, Limitations of Make, Making testsuite Scripts):
	Don't put '-o' after non-options, as POSIX doesn't allow this.
	Mention that cc's name might be gcc or c89 or whatever.

2004-01-04  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	(&sizes): New.
	Use them.
	No longer rely on Gnus to inline the list of signatures: compute
	them on the fly.

2003-11-24  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC_G): Use language-specific

	The test suite are sometimes assigning timings incorrectly.
	Reported by Henk Krus.
	Diagnosed by Nicolas Joly.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_CLEANUP): Rename AT_help as
	AT_help_all.

	* tests/wrapper.as (AUTOCONF, AUTOM4TE, ): Point to tests/
	executables, not bin/ executables!  Otherwise all the magic needed
	to find non installed files is turned off.  This caused a failure
	of test 40 and 41 that ran aclocal 1.8 which in turn ran autom4te
	as found in its environment (sent by tests/autoreconf): pointing
	to bin/autom4te that could not find its files.

	Add support for newer Fortran dialects.  The F77 interface is

2003-08-21  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	First stab at preserving warnings between calls to autom4te,
	including when the cache is used.

	There are still several issues: (i) there are too many runs of m4
	(one for include, one for warnings, and some more), (ii) warnings
	spreading on several lines are not handled gracefully, (iii) the
	code meant to have the call stack display for errors does not work
	(its handling should move from m4 to autom4te).

	* bin/autom4te.in Autom4te::Channels, Autom4te::ChannelDefs):
	Use them.
	(@preselect): Add m4_warn.
	($exit_status): Remove, use $exit_code.
	($help): Use Autom4te::ChannelDefs::usage.
	(&handle_m4): No longer define the m4_warnings.
	At each run, extract and report the warnings.
	Always cache the result, including if the exit status is on
	failure, since if nothing changes, we should result in the same
	failure, hence we can use the cache.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_warning_ifelse, _m4_warning_ifelse)
	(_m4_warning_error_ifelse, __m4_warning_error_ifelse, _m4_warn):
	Remove.
	(m4_warn): Redefine as a do-nothing: it is its invocation that
	matters, as warnings are now reported via traces.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_DIAGNOSE): Don't make it a copy of
	the contents of m4_warn: make it _call_ m4_warn, so that tracing
	the latter reveals calls to the former.

	Adjust the tests.

	* tests/m4sugar.at (m4@&t@_warn): Use existing warning categories.

2003-08-21  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	output.

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_MMAP): Cast pointer to
	'long', not 'int', for benefit of Sun's recent C++ compilers
	(trivial change).  See:
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2003-07/msg00007.html
	(This really should be 'intptr_t', not 'long', but that would
	take more work.)

	* lib/Makefile.am (autom4te.cfg): Make it read only.
	Depend on Makefile since it contains substitutions.

2003-06-23  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Report a single config.log,
	not all of them.  This fixes 1. the fact that when testing
	Autoconf there are many many config.log, 2. the incorrect use of
	top_srcdir to find config.log.
	Don't mix the detailed output of failed test with the summary of
	failures.  Rather, append detailed log afterwards.

2003-06-23  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_CONFIGURE): Adjust to the verbose being
	always run: output config.log on $at_group_log.

	63 for version mismatches.

2003-05-23  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoconf/status.m4: Prefer "TAB-SP" to "SP-TAB", because of
	Emacs' dangerous whitespace.el behavior (smashing "useless" spaces in
	the middle of a line).
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4: Likewise.
	Remove useless spaces in comments.

2003-05-23  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_version_prereq): Failure causes an

	    Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (_AC_PROG_CXX_EXIT_DECLARATION):
	Remove `#include <stdlib.h>' from the list; we should never
	make confdefs.h include <stdlib.h> or <cstdlib>, because the
	resulting namespace pollution would cause other tests to fail.
	Configure scripts run with some older versions of g++ and HP's
	aCC would fail due to such an #include.  Problems reported by
	Matthew Mueller in <http://bugs.debian.org/120704> and by
	Keith Bostic in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2003-05/msg00063.html>.
	In the test, use the test declaration before including <stdlib.h>,
	as that's closer to how it'll be used.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Header Portability): ucred.h.
	From Ian Redfern.

2003-05-22  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	Overhaul Autotest's logging: generate separate log files
	in testsuite.dir/NNN/testsuite.log, and append them to
	testsuite.log instead of re-running the test verbosely.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Use a single redirected
	file descriptor, write 0 to at_status_file instead of setting
	at_status=0, initialize some new variables (at_status_file,
	at_group_log, at_suite_log, at_tee_pipe).  Remove the cruft
	to rerun the tests, instead append the at_group_log to the
	at_suite_log when a test fails.
	(AT_SETUP): pipe the test case's output into at_tee_pipe,
	with the AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD redirected to stdout.
	(AT_CLEANUP): save the output status in $at_status_file
	and restore it, redirect the AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD back to
	its original place.
	(AT_CHECK): since tests are run with a redirected stdout,
	and used to be re-run in verbose mode, turn some $at_verbose
	into echo, and don't redirect the output of testing stdout
	and stderr.

	* lib/autotest/autoconf.texi (testsuite Scripts): Update
	the name of the debugging directory and information about
	its contents.

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_LANG_FUNC_LINK_TRY(C)): Define $1 to an
	innocuous variant befor including <limits.h> or <assert.h>.  This

	.c and the .h files that they generate.  This fixes the bug
	reported by Tim Van Holder in:
	<http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bison-patches/2002-November/001352.html>
	Look for N_ as well as for _.  Try to avoid matching #define for

2002-11-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoconf/autoheader.m4 (_AH_TEMPLATE_OLD, _AH_VERBATIM_OLD):
	Remove.
	We _have_ to stop using the old compatibility scheme that tried to
	avoid useless backslashes because Libtool 1.4.3 contains a
	AC_DEFINE([error_t], [int],
	[Define to a type to use for \`error_t' if it is not
	otherwise available.])
	We _have_ to quote the single quote and backslashes with \.  The
	old compatibility scheme saw that ` was backslashed, and therefore
	did not quote the single quote.  Hence before this patch, Autoconf
	was not compatible with Libtool.

2002-11-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	to frozen files in @ARGV, as @ARGV must remain being a list of
	files.  Rather, at M4 call sites, use this...
	(&files_to_options): New function.
	(&freeze): Use &error.
	(&up_to_date): If a file that was included according to the cache
	is no longer there, then the output is out dated.
	(&main): Don't even check whether a file is up to date is anyway
	--force is given.
	* tests/tools.at (autom4te cache): New.

2002-10-16  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoconf.as: Kill dead options.
	* bin/autoupdate.in (&parse_args): Kill old options.
	* bin/autoreconf.in (&parse_args): Remove dead options.
	Factor some code.
	(&autoreconf): Report the directories we enter *and leave*, so
	that error messages can be easily located, and use GNU Make
	format, so that Emacs' compile mode understands us.
	* lib/Autom4te/General.pm (&update_file): Use `verbose' to report
	if some file was changed instead of `print'.
	* bin/autoheader.in: Suggest AC_DEFINE with 3 args when needed.
	(&parse_args): Remove the dead options.
	* tests/atspecific.m4 (AT_CHECK_AUTOHEADER): Adjust to the new
	autoheader's quiet mode.
	(AT_CHECK_AUTOUPDATE): Likewise.
	* tests/tools.at (autoupdate): Adjust.
	* tests/semantics.at (AC_C_BIGENDIAN): Likewise.

2002-10-11  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	No longer use CPP to check for the existing of headers: use CC to
	check for compilability.

	* lib/autoconf/headers.m4 (_AC_CHECK_HEADER_MONGREL)
	(AC_CHECK_HEADER, _AC_CHECK_HEADER_OLD): Remove.
	(_AC_CHECK_HEADER_NEW): Rename as...

	numbers in the Subject suggestion.

2002-10-11  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	file name to enable parallel executions.
	From Sam Varshavchik.

2002-10-08  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoreconf.in (&autoreconf): Run autopoint before the first
	aclocal invocation, as Gettext macros might not be visible to
	aclocal.
	Instead of blindly running autopoint, scan configure.ac (not the
	traces) for AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION uses, as autopoint does.
	Reported by Paul D. Smith.

2002-10-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Work around problems found when POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 is set.
	None of this seems to have anything to do with POSIX, really,
	but it's how Perl getopt works.
	* bin/autom4te.in (parse_args): Configure GetOpt with
	"permute", too.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Invoking autom4te):
	--warning -> --warnings.

2002-09-28  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/torture.at (Configuring subdirectories): Be robust to
	users who use config.site to require for a cache: in this case,
	the two last configure runs, using two different sets of
	arguments, trigger a legitimate error.

2002-09-28  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/m4sh.at (Functions Support, Functions and return Support):

	* lib/freeze.mk (autoconf_m4f_dependencies): Add autoscan.m4.

	(autoscan.pre): New file.

	* lib/autoscan/autoscan.list: this.
	* bin/autoscan.in (&init_tables): Adjust.

2002-09-28  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoscan/functions, lib/autoscan/headers,
	* lib/autoscan/identifiers, lib/autoscan/makevars,
	* lib/autoscan/programs: Make the `kind' explicit, i.e., each
	`functions' line is now prefixed with `function:'.
	* bin/autoscan.in (&init_tables): Adjust.

2002-09-28  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	jm_FUNC_MBRTOWC, by Paul Eggert, from the Coreutils 4.5.1.
	* lib/autoscan/functions: Adjust.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Functions): Adjust.

2002-09-27  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Some about mv
	from /tmp.
	Thanks to Bill Moseley and Paul Eggert.

	* bin/Makefile.am (autoconf, autoheader, autoreconf, autoupdate)
	(ifnames, autoscan, autom4te): Un-factor into several rules.

2002-09-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* BUGS (Interoperability bugs): New section.  Mention libtool
	1.4.2, configure.ac, and AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR interoperability bug.

2002-09-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix a portability bug reported by Alexandre Duret-Lutz: Solaris 8
	make handles suffix-rules differently from GNU make.

	* bin/Makefile.am (SUFFIXES, .in): Remove.
	(autoconf autoheader autoreconf autoupdate ifnames autoscan autom4te):
	Move the body of the old .in rule here.

2002-09-16  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	i960 compilers create `b.out' files by default.
	Reported by Ralf Corsepius.

	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT): Remove b.out files.

	Suggested by Guido Draheim.

2002-09-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoreconf.in: Don't use Cwd::chdir, since in its internals
	(chdir_init) might hang when stat'ing mounted directories.
	Reported by Vance Shipley.

2002-09-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoscan.in (&parse_args): Pass a reference to the lists, not
	the lists.

2002-09-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Defining Symbols): Present two different
	prototypes for AC_DEFINE and AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED to emphasize the
	difference between 1 argument calls, and 2-3 argument calls.

2002-09-12  Peter Eisentraut  <peter_e@gmx.net>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Review grammar and punctuation.

2002-09-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Fix minor formatting, spelling, and
	grammatical typos.
	(Defining Symbols): Explain that AC_DEFINE(var) defaults to 1, but
	AC_DEFINE(var,,description) does not; and the AC_DEFINE(var) case
	is obsolescent.

2002-09-11  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Questions): Rename as...
	(FAQ): this.
	(Defining Directories): New.

2002-09-09  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Making testsuite Scripts): Update.
	Suggested by Nishio Futoshi.

2002-09-09  Koji Arai  <JCA02266@nifty.ne.jp>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Making testsuite Scripts): Use `@@' where a
	plain `@' is wanted.

2002-09-09  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Keep the
	`duplicates', since the algorithm was too naive and could keep
	`--prefix=1 --prefix=2 --prefix=1' as `--prefix=1 --prefix=2', and
	keep `--prefix foo --prefix bar' as `--prefix foo bar'.
	Reported by Ralf Corsepius.
	* tests/torture.at (Configuring subdirectories): Exercise these

2002-09-09  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	precious variables are.
	Suggested by Pontus Skoeld.

2002-09-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/Makefile.am (autoconf, autoheader, autoreconf, autoupdate)
	(ifnames, autoscan, autom4te): Since we don't only depend on
	configure.ac variables (such as VERSION etc.), but also on prefix
	and so forth, depend on Makefile, not configure.ac.
	Reported by Alexandre Duret-Lutz.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Installation Directory Variables): Adjust.

2002-09-05  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make): HP-UX trailing backslashes
	doesn't seem to be confined to ia64, just say "some versions".

2002-09-04  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am: Remove pdf targets, handled by
	Automake 1.6c.

2002-09-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Brinkmann.

2002-09-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* configure.ac: Bump to 2.53d.
	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Require 1.6c, i.e., CVS Automake
	as of today, on Automake's team suggestion.

2002-09-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 2.53c.

2002-09-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

2002-09-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (AC_SYS_POSIX_TERMIOS): Reflect renaming: s/am/ac/,
	i.e., change am_cv_sys_posix_termios to ac_cv_sys_posix_termios.
	Also, tweak grammar: s/make sure to/be sure to/.

2002-09-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Builtins): Explain why logical
	directory names are generally preferable to physical names.

2002-09-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/Autom4te/General.pm (&update_file): s/die/error/.
	Reported by Raja R. Harinath.
	* bin/autoheader.in, bin/autoreconf.in, bin/autoscan.in,
	* bin/autoupdate.in: Use error instead of die.

2002-09-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/mktests.sh (ac_exclude_egrep, au_exclude_egrep): Use
	ordinary shell concatenation rather than echo+tr+sed command that
	runs afoul of a long-line-related sed bug in Solaris 8.

	* bin/autoheader.in (parse_args): --warning -> --warnings.

	* bin/autoconf.as: Work even if "ls" outputs "FOO not found" to
	stdout, as traditional "ls" does.
	* lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT,
	_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_O): Likewise.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Add "ls".

	* bin/autoconf.as: Add --prepend-include option.  This patch was
	applied to bin/autoconf.in in the 2002-07-17 patch by Mark D. Roth,
	but bin/autoconf.in is generated automatically from bin/autoconf.as.

	* bin/autoconf.in, configure: Regenerate.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Shell Variables): Mention
	ENV, MAIL, MAILPATH, PS1, PS2, PS4.  Index PWD.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_SHELL_SANITIZE): Unset ENV, MAIL,
	MAILPATH and set PS1, PS2, PS4 to default values, to work
	around bug in pre-3.0 UWIN ksh reported by Bruce Lilly.
	For LC_ALL etc, first try to set to "C" as POSIX requires and as
	the Autoconf documentation specifies; fall back to "unset" only if
	this fails.  Use a shell for-loop for this rather than an m4 loop,
	to shorten the output script.

2002-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Shell Variables): Mention POSIX
	1003.1-2001's requirements for CDPATH.  Give a simpler workaround
	for the CDPATH problem.  Document PWD.
	(Limitations of Builtins): Document the problem that "cd $foo" and
	"ls $foo" may refer to different directories in shells conforming
	to POSIX 1003.1-2001.  Use PS1 rather than CDPATH for "unset"
	example, since the old example is now out of date.

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_SRCDIR): Reject FOO if "cd
	FOO" and "ls FOO" talk about different directories; this catches
	problems when POSIX 1003.1-2001 "cd" fails due to symlink
	spaghetti.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_SHELL_SANITIZE): Use AS_UNSET instead
	of rolling our own unset.
	(_AS_PREPARE): $as_unset CDPATH instead of AS_UNSETting it, since
	in practice we needn't worry about CDPATH if unset doesn't work.

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, bin/Makefile.in,
	config/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in,
	lib/Autom4te/Makefile.in, lib/autoconf/Makefile.in,
	lib/autoscan/Makefile.in, lib/autotest/Makefile.in,
	lib/emacs/Makefile.in, lib/m4sugar/Makefile.in, man/Makefile.in,
	tests/Makefile.in: Regenerate with Automake 1.6.3.

	* config/config.guess, config/config.sub, config/mkinstalldirs:
	Update.

	* configure: Regenerate with self.

2002-08-30  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Notes on "cc"
	default output.

2002-08-29  Rainer Orth  <ro@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE>

	* bin/autom4te.in (Request::load): Correctly test for "do" read
	failure.

2002-08-29  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/Autom4te/General.pm (&xqx): New.
	(&xsystem): Use WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS instead of decoding $? by
	hand, which is not portable.
	(&error): New.
	* bin/autom4te.in: Use them.
	Use &error instead of die.
	* tests/m4sugar.at (m4_warn, m4_require: circular dependencies):
	Adjust.

2002-08-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (AC_PROG_F77): Remove fc from the
	default list of compilers to try, since it was long ago superseded
	by the ksh fc builtin.  Suggested by Steven G. Johnson.

2002-07-31  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <duret_g@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Invoking autom4te): End the option table,
	fixing a bug introduced by the previous patch.
	(Limitations of Make): Add a 'target lookup' subentry in the
	'VPATH' entry.  Rewrite all `make' occurences as `@command{make}'.

2002-07-29  Mark D. Roth  <roth@feep.net>

	* bin/autom4te.in: Remove --include-envvar and --site-macro-subdir
	options and use $AUTOM4TE_PATH.
	* doc/autoconf.texi: Remove documentation of autom4te
	--include-envvar and --site-macro-subdir options and document
	use of $AUTOM4TE_PATH.
	* lib/autom4te.in: Remove --include-envvar and --site-macro-subdir
	arguments from each language section.

2002-07-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/install.texi: Include copyright symbol in copyright notice.

	* Makefile.am (MAKEINFO): Remove; it's a user-specified macro.
	Replace with:
	(AM_MAKEINFOFLAGS): New macro.
	* doc/Makefile.am (MAKEINFO, AM_MAKEINFOFLAGS): Likewise.
	* Makefile.am (INSTALL): Use the new macros.
	Use -o rather than --output, since "missing" does not grok --output.

2002-07-25  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <duret_g@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make): Escaped newlines in
	comments do not always work. Never trust the exit status of
	`make -k'.

2002-07-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make, Making testsuite Scripts):
	Untabify, since tabs are not enjoyed by texi2dvi and makeinfo.

2002-07-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_PATH_SEPARATOR_PREPARE):
	Use PATH="/nonexistent;.", not PATH=".;.", as FreeBSD ksh2002
	apparently treats PATH="nonexistent" as if it contained ".".
	Bug reported by Stefan `Sec' Zehl.

2002-07-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <duret_g@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make): Mention the special
	handling of the obj/ directory by BSD make.

2002-07-20  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make): Add HP-UX IA-64 trailing

	the member is itself an aggregate.  Bug reported by Sergey Poznyakoff.
	This improves on an earlier suggestion by H. Peter Anvin.

2002-05-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	AC_FUNC_FNMATCH now tests only for POSIX compatibility.
	AC_FUNC_FNMATCH_GNU also tests for GNU extensions.
	Both macros now accept an optional source-dir arg.
	New macro AC_GNU_SOURCE to define _GNU_SOURCE.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Functions, UNIX Variants): Likewise.

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (_AC_FUNC_FNMATCH): New macro.
	(AC_FUNC_FNMATCH): Use it.  Test only for POSIX conformance,

	(AC_FUNC_FNMATCH_GNU): New macro.

	* lib/autoconf/specific.m4 (AC_GNU_SOURCE): New macro.

	and it causes a 'test' syntax error if it fails.
	Bug reported by Stephen Gildea.

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED):
	If prototypes are supported, use them to check this at compile-time,
	instead of trying to check it at run-time.  If we must do a run-time
	check, assume that setvbuf is standard when cross-compiling, as
	nonstandard setvbuf occurs only on ancient and unlikely hosts.
	Bug reported by Paul D. Smith.

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG): Add optional
	argument specifying location of getloadavg.c.  This removes a
	FIXME.  This idea was taken from Jim Meyering's implementation in
	textutils.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Functions): Document this.
	Also, mention HAVE_NLIST_H rather than NLIST_STRUCT, since
	that's what the code does; this fixes a bug reported by
	Paul D. Smith.

2002-05-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

2002-04-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* bin/autoreconf.in (autoreconf): Don't age aclocal.m4's input
	files to be 1 second older; just set them to be the same time.
	Also, sleep 1 second after the first aclocal, to work around
	problems with sub-second time stamps on the input files.

2002-04-29  Thien-Thi Nguyen  <ttn@gnu.org>

	* doc/autoconf.texi: Mention "set -e -x" lossage

	running configure.
	From Christian Cornelssen.

2002-04-29  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/m4sh.at (LINENO): If testsuite itself is rewritten because
	of lack of $LINENO support, then the test will compare the $LINENO
	in testsuite vs. the lineno in the test file.  This is wrong, of
	course.
	Be sure to protect it.
	Reported by Patrick Welche.

2002-04-25  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Obsolete Macros): Typo.

2002-04-25  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoreconf.in (autoreconf): Don't let aclocal.m4 be older
	than some of the input files, hence, on the second run of aclocal,
	if some of its input are younger, make them older.
	Suggested by Paul Eggert.

2002-04-25  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	DEFAULT diversion.
	(_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Use them to log them.
	(_AC_SUBST, _AC_SUBST_SED_PROGRAM): Remove.
	(AC_SUBST, AC_SUBST_FILE): Instead of buliding the
	_AC_SUBST_SED_PROGRAM, store the list of output files/variables in
	_AC_SUBST_FILES and _AC_SUBST_VARS.
	* lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES): Adjust.

2002-04-24  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_BASENAME_PREPARE): New macro.

	* tests/m4sh.at: Don't rely on "PATH=test:$PATH test-1" working
	as POSIX requires, as it doesn't work with Zsh.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Assignments): Document the problem.

2002-03-25  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <duret_g@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Make): Mention more issue
	about VPATH, overriding of macros in sub-makes, and handling of
	SHELL.

2002-03-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Here-Documents): Mention Solaris 8 dtksh
	problem with here-document buffer boundaries.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_LINENO_PREPARE): Unset ENV and BASH_ENV
	when reinvoking the shell, to work around problems with installers
	who put strange things like "cd" commands in their environments.

2002-03-19  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/semantics.at (AC_C_BIGENDIAN): s/unknow/unknown/.
	From Aaron Ucko.

2002-03-19  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	(Limitations of Usual Tools): Add mkdir section.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_MKDIR_P_PREPARE): New macro.
	(AS_MKDIR_P): Require it.  Use mkdir -p if available, falling
	back on AS_DIRNAME to compute prefixes otherwise; this is
	roughly what mkinstalldirs does.  That way, we need not have
	our own filename disassembler.  The old disassembler did not
	work with Solaris 8 dtksh, which is ksh Version M-12/28/93d.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT, AT_CLEANUP):
	Create at_test_all by a series of assignments,
	not by a single assignment of a long string.  The latter causes ksh
	version 11/16/88g to silently misbehave on OpenServer 5.0.6a,
	presumably because of a buffer overrun.

2002-03-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (at_times_skip):
	Renamed from at_times.  Now a boolean.

	affect the latter.

2002-03-08  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autom4te.in (&handle_m4): Protect us from corrupted file

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Transforming Names): Equality between target

	(Specifying Names, Canonicalizing): Remove all references to the

	(Hosts and Cross-Compilation): this new section.
	* doc/install.texi (System Type): Ditto.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_CANONICAL_HOST): Explicitly state
	that `--host' implies cross-compilation.

2002-03-04  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Evaluation Macros): New.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_lquote): Remove, it is totally
	useless.
	(_m4_foreach): Define the variant with immediate evaluation so
	that it contains exactly the items, not an expression which
	evaluation is the current item.
	(m4_re_string, m4_re_word): Don't over quote them.

2002-03-04  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	(m4_car2): Remove, replaced by...

	(_m4_foreach): Adjust.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Adjust, and use

2002-03-03  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Don't be ridiculous: adjust
	AUTOTEST_PATH *after* it was set.
	Don't put `.' in the PATH: the user should be precise and `./' if
	needed.  In addition, given that the test suite does some `cd', if
	`.' is in the path, the `tested programs' sections will report
	programs found in the test suite's directory, while during the
	tests (performed in their own directory), these programs are no
	longer visible.  In other words, the results is confusing and
	useless.
	* tests/m4sh.at: Adjust: don't rely on `.' being in the PATH.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Using an Autotest Test Suite): New.
	(testsuite Scripts): Be one of its subsection.
	(Autotest Logs): New.

2001-11-26  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Test groups are now run two directories deeper.

	* lib/autoconf/autotest.m4 (AC_CONFIG_TESTDIR): Replace srcdir,
	top_srcdir and top_builddir with at_srcdir, at_top_srcdir and
	at_top_builddir.
	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Compute srcdir,
	top_srcdir, builddir and top_builddir.
	Use `at_*dir' relatively to the directory containing the
	suite, use `*dir' when relatively to the current group dir.

2001-11-25  Joseph S. Myers  <jsm28@cam.ac.uk>

	* doc/autoconf.texi, TODO, lib/autoconf/fortran.m4,
	lib/autoconf/functions.m4, lib/autoconf/headers.m4,

	spelling errors.

2001-11-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <duret_g@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Using System Type): Add an example of `case
	$host' usage so people quit using `case $target' everywhere.

2001-11-22  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Installation Directory Variables): Englishoes
	spotted by Jim Meyering.

2001-11-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	This patch implements a `long double' suggestion by Oliver Kiddle.

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_LANG_BOOL_COMPILE_TRY(C)): Make the array
	static, to catch errors if the value isn't known at compile-time
	and the compiler supports dynamic arrays.  Change its name from
	`_array_' to `test_array' to avoid potential name clashes.
	(AC_C_LONG_DOUBLE): Make it a compile-time test, not a run-time
	test.  Do not define HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE if `long double' is no
	better than double.  Catch a bug in GCC 2.95.2 x86.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (C Compiler): Document the above.
	* NEWS: Likewise.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/m4sh.at (LINENO): Protect from autom4te's substitution by
	hand.
	* tests/tools.at: Don't protect dnl, AT_DATA_M4SH does.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): After having run the test
	group, go back to the initial directory, not to at_suite_dir.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/atspecific.m4 (AT_DATA_M4SUGAR, AT_DATA_M4SH)
	(AT_DATA_AUTOCONF):  Also protect @&t@ from autom4te.
	(AT_CHECK_AUTOCONF, AT_CHECK_AUTOHEADER): Pass no --include
	option.
	(AT_CHECK_CONFIGURE): Use absolute paths.
	(_AT_CHECK_AC_MACRO): Create aclocal.m4 with AC_STATE_SAVE in it.
	The problem is still the old one: there is no means in M4 (that I
	know about) to create a defining macro, because there is no means
	to create `$1' etc., therefore, the defining macro ``swallows''
	all the arguments meant to the defined macro.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/atspecific.m4 (AT_DATA_AUTOCONF): New.
	(AT_CONFIGURE_AC): Output the definition of AC_STATE_SAVE in
	configure.ac.
	* tests/aclocal.m4: Remove, as it is no longer used.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4: Change `tests?' into `groups?' in
	variable names when referring to a single test group, or to
	`suite' when referring to the whole test suite.
	`at_last_test' is removed: m4 compute at_format itself.
	(at_stdout, at_stder1, at_stderr): New variables.
	(AT_CHECK): Use them.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Be sure to put `.', relative,
	in PATH.
	Create `testsuite.dir/003/run' instead of `testsuite.003'.
	Do it as soon as a test fails, don't wait till the end of the test
	suite.
	Don't remove $as_me.[0-9]*, since these files no longer exist.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/tools.at: Use absolute paths, since we are no longer run
	in place.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Now that tests are running in their own private dir, there is no
	need to list the files to remove at the end of tests groups.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (_AT_CLEANUP_FILE, AT_CLEANUP_FILES):
	(AT_data_files, at_data_files): Remove.
	(AT_CLEANUP, AT_DATA): Simplify.
	(AT_INIT): Adjust.
	Remove the group dir if !debug && !failed.
	* tests/atspecific.m4: Adjust.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Start a new layout for Autotest: `testsuite' creates
	`testsuite.dir' in which the at-check-line etc. files are to be
	found, and `testsuite.dir/003' where the test group 3 is run.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): at_tests_dir,
	at_check_line_file, at_format, at_test_normalized, at_group_dir
	are new variables.
	Create the directories.
	Use absolute paths for at- files.
	(AT_CHECK): Adjust.

2001-11-11  Michael Matz  <matz@kde.org>

	* m4sugar.m4 (_m4_foreach): Make it linear instead quadratic.
	(m4_car2): New.
	(m4_car): Properly quote arguments.

2001-11-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/aclocal.m4 (AC_STATE_SAVE): s/LIBOBJS/LIB@&t@OBJS/ to cope
	with stricter rules on LIBOBJS.

2001-11-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_PROTOTYPES): Define __PROTOTYPES too.

	* lib/autoconf/headers.m4, lib/autoconf/libs.m4,
	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4, lib/autoconf/specific.m4,
	* lib/autoconf/types.m4: When invoking AC_DEFINE and friends,
	specify to what the macro should be defined (typically to 1).

2001-11-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_STRTOD): AC_SUBST POW_LIB.
	From Jim Meyering.

2001-11-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (_AC_PROG_LEX_YYTEXT_DECL): Use
	AC_TRY_EVAL to run $LEX, not AC_TRY_COMMAND.  This validates the
	definition used by Automake where LEX is +/- "${missing} lex" and
	`missing' itself contains variables.

2001-11-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Push KILL at the end.
	Now that M4sh pushes BODY, the comments were output at the end of
	the test suites.

2001-11-08  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoreconf.in (&autoreconf): Run aclocal before tracing, so
	that we can trace macros from aclocal.m4.
	Trace AC_PROG_LIBTOOL, not AM_PROG_LIBTOOL, since the latter is
	obsoleted, and redirect to the former anyway.
	Reported by Ralf Corsepius.

2001-11-08  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoreconf.in (&autoreconf): AC_CONFIG_SUBIDRS are to be

	* tests/torture.at (Configuring subdirectories): Use autoreconf
	instead of successive calls to autoconf.
	Add a nonexistent subdirectory to exercise the patch above.

	Use and export them.
	(&find_configure_ac): Optionally take a directory where to look at.
	* bin/autoreconf.in (&parse_args): Trim the configure.ac part of
	the arguments.
	Default @ARGV to `.', not find_configure_ac.
	(&autoreconf): Argument is a directory.
	Trace AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS and schedule the subdirs for autoreconf'ing.

	Don't look for aclocal flags if we already know aclocal is not
	used.
	Move aclocal.m4t only if it exists.
	Reported by Ezra Peisach.

2001-11-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoreconf.in (&parse_args): Work only on the configure.ac
	passed on command line, defaulting to ./configure.ac if present.
	(&maybe_autoreconf, File::Find): Remove, unused.
	(&autoreconf): If autoconf is not used, don't try to trace.

2001-11-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* configure.ac: Bump to 2.52g.

2001-11-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autoreconf.in (&autoreconf): Set `$aclocal_flags' to ''.
	Don't run aclocal when aclocal.m4 is not from aclocal.
	From Ezra Peisach.
	Don't run libtoolize and gettextize if --install is not given.

2001-11-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_SHELL_SANITIZE): _AS_CR_PREPARE needs to
	be invoked before _AS_LINENO_PREPARE.
	(_AS_LINENO_PREPARE): Use as_cr_digits and as_cr_alnum rather
	than character ranges.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_SHELL_SANITIZE): Fix NLS before
	invoking AS_BASENAME.  Set the locale variables to 'C' if
	possible, as POSIX requires this to get the traditional
	behavior.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Shell Variables): Describe the above.

2001-10-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_LINENO_WORKS): Do not surround body
	with {}, as that triggers a bug in Bash 2.05.

	(_AS_LINENO_PREPARE): Use Sed rather than
	Awk.  Fix the sed prepass to work even if there are multiple
	instances of $LINENO on the same line.  Do not substitute for
	other variables like $LINENOT.  Do not check file dates; such a
	check is unreliable on sufficiently fast machines, and removing
	the check makes the code simpler and more reliable.  Check for
	output and chmod failures.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Shell Variables): Document
	the above.

2001-10-31  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	AC_CONFIG_FILES(atlocal) as it means a file atlocal.in *must* be
	provided, while it is optional.
	* configure.ac: Adjust.

2001-10-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, README, configure.ac, lib/Autom4te/General.pm,
	  lib/Autom4te/Struct.pm:
	Require Perl 5.005_03 instead of just 5.005, as some tests fail
	with 5.005_02.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Special Shell Variables): Document some
	more LINENO gotchas, particularly with respect to the Awk+Sed hack.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_LINENO_WORKS): New macro.
	(_AS_LINENO_PREPARE): Use it instead of shell eval, since
	eval $LINENO is not portable in practice.

2001-10-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_STRERROR_R):
	Rename ac_cv_func_strerror_r_works to ac_cv_func_strerror_r_char_p,
	and rename HAVE_WORKING_STRERROR_R to STRERROR_R_CHAR_P, since
	POSIX decided to standardize on the int flavor of strerror_r.
	Always do char* test, as there's no reason not to.
	Assign to a char* var, to catch strerror_r that returns int*.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Functions):
	Document the above changes.  Also, document the fact that
	AC_FUNC_STRERROR_R defines HAVE_DECL_STRERROR_R.

	* NEWS: Mention HAVE_WORKING_STRERROR_R -> STRERROR_R_CHAR_P.

2001-10-20  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	(&parse_args): Use -I, --include instead of the old Autoconf
	options.
	($localdir, $autoconf_dir): Remove.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_DIRNAME): Use 'dirname' if that works.
	(AS_BASENAME_EXPR): New macro.
	(AS_BASENAME_SED): Do not assume GNU sed semantics.
	(AS_BASENAME): Use 'basename' if that works; then try 'expr';
	and fall back on 'sed' only if the other two fail.  This makes
	AS_BASENAME act more like AS_DIRNAME.
	(as_me): Shell-quote the argument of AS_BASENAME, in case $0
	contains white space.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_SRCDIR):
	Use AS_DIRNAME, since I think it's now DOS-friendly.

	* doc/autoconf.texi (config.status Invocation):
	CONFIG_SHELL defaults to a shell that supports LINENO if available.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_LINENO_PREPARE): If the current
	shell does not support LINENO, and if CONFIG_SHELL is unset or
	empty, and if we can find a shell that does support LINENO,
	then set CONFIG_SHELL to that shell and then re-execute
	ourselves with CONFIG_SHELL.

2001-10-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (clean-local): Don't invoke $(TESTSUITE) if it

2001-10-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	somewhat-incorrect example involving "." and "/".

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_SHELL_SANITIZE): "source" -> ".", for
	compatibility with POSIX shells.

2001-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Report an error if the size cannot be determined even though
	the type exists.
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_COMPUTE_INT_COMPILE):

	This makes _AC_COMPUTE_INT_COMPILE more like _AC_COMPUTE_INT_RUN.
	(_AC_COMPUTE_INT): Pass IF-FAILS arg to _AC_COMPUTE_INT_COMPILE.

	(Broken/missing compilers, AC_PROG_CPP with warnings)
	(AC_PROG_CPP without warnings, AC_PROG_CPP via CC)
	(AC_PROG_CPP requires AC_PROG_CC): here and...
	* tests/fortran.at (GNU Fortran 77): there.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (autoconf Invocation): Fix the example:
	AC_TRY_RUN is about compilation, not shell commands.
	(Test Programs): AC_TRY_RUN works as used to be advertised.

2001-09-27  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_SHELL_SANITIZE): Fix bugs spotted by
	Raja R Harinath:
	Be sure to detect when $LINENO always returns the same value.
	Look for the original script, basename($0) is certainly not
	enough.
	Pass the CLI arguments to `$as_me.lineno'.

2001-09-25  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Dump the whole config.log.

	PATH_SEPARATOR.
	(Special Shell Variables[PATH_SEPARATOR]): Ditto.

2001-09-19  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4: Englishoes.

	to getpgrp.

	* lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (_AC_FUNC_GETPGRP_TEST): Remove.
	(AC_FUNC_GETPGRP): Don't bother with a runtime test.  Just check

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4: Fix AS_BASENAME so that it passes the previous
	added test. It now correctly handles /1/2/3/, returning '3' not ''.

	* tests/base.at: Fixed the expected responses. The old ones were
	one line out...
	* lib/autoconf/general.m4: Fixed AC_PREFIX_PROGRAM, it now behaves as
	the documentation claims it should (and how it behaved in 2.13).

2001-09-18  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoconf/autotest.m4 (AC_CONFIG_TESTDIR): No INIT-CMDS in

	* lib/autom4te.in (Autotest): Add `package.m4?'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (package.m4): New.

	Fix bug reported by Paul Townsend on AIX 4.3.3.0 with CFLAGS=-O4
	or CFLAGS=-O5.  In that case, the linker has a relaxed view of
	fatal errors, and AC_CHECK_LIB causes it to include libraries even
	when they don't exist.

	* lib/autoconf/headers.m4 (AC_HEADER_DIRENT): Use AC_SEARCH_LIBS,
	not AC_CHECK_LIB, so that we don't use -ldir or -lx if we don't
	need it.

	* lib/autoconf/specific.m4 (AC_ISC_POSIX): Replace the old, crufty
	version with the version used by fileutils 4.1, except use

	* doc/autoconf.texi (AC_ISC_POSIX): Describe new behavior.

2001-08-31  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/Autom4te/General.pm (&find_peer): Remove.

	We only need PERL.
	* tests/atspecific.m4, tests/tools.at: Passing --localdir is
	indeed related to running the test suite, while passing
	--autoconf-dir and others is related to running non installed
	Autoconf executables.  So don't do that, leave it to...
	* tests/autoconf, tests/autoheader, tests/autom4te, tests/autoupdate,
	* tests/autoscan: New.
	* tests/atspecific.m4 (AT_CHECK_M4SUGAR, AT_CHECK_M4SH): Don't

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4, lib/autoconf/specific.m4,

2001-08-17  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

2001-08-17  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Refer to `$as_me.log', not
	`$0.log' as for projects where testsuite is in src, we'd have

2001-08-11  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <duret_g@epita.fr>

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_BIGENDIAN): Handle ACTION-IF-TRUE,
	ACTION-IF-FALSE, and ACTION-IF-UNKNOWN.
	* doc/autoconf.texi (C Compiler Characteristics): Update

	* lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_BIGENDIAN): Guess endianness by grep'ing
	magic values from an object file when cross-compiling.
	Based on code by Guido Draheim <Guido.Draheim@gmx.de>.

2001-08-10  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* bin/autom4te.in (&handle_output): Don't use `grep' with side
	effects.
	Suggested by Russ Allbery.

2001-08-10  Ralf Corsepius  <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_SUBDIRS): Propagate the

	* bin/autom4te.in ($icache): Load it only if older than autom4te.

2001-08-07  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): All the `at-*' are to be
	removed.
	(at-setup-line): Huh?  Be a variable `at_setup_line', not a file.
	No need to remove the files before and after the each test, before
	each test and at the end of the suite is enough.
	Display only the children `times', not the shell's.
	If the test failed or was skipped, at-times is not available.

2001-08-07  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Always produce testsuite.log, including when there are no
	failures.  This helps getting information on skipped tests, and
	duration of the tests.  Err, implement the latter btw.

	* lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Set up fd 6 for the log.
	Dump information on the first run of each test.
	(AT_CLEANUP): Create `at-times' containing the duration of the
	test group.

2001-08-07  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	The use of `dumpstat' revealed that `len' was used although it
	should not.  m4_text_wrap was using it, but in the Autoconf world
	where it is legal.  Hence (i) test M4sh in its own world, not
	Autoconf's, and (ii), ahem, fix the bug :)

	* lib/autotest/general.m4: Be sure the set good quotes, as tracing
	does not like `' instead of [].
	(AT_INIT): Forbid `^_?AT_'.
	And don't output such tokens.
	* tests/Makefile.am (CLEANFILES): Add `script', `script.s4g',
	`script.as', and `autom4te.cache'.
	Remove `empty' and `macro' which are no longer used.
	* tests/atspecific.m4 (AT_CHECK_M4SUGAR, AT_CHECK_M4SH): New.
	* tests/m4sugar.at: Use it.
	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4: Use `m4_len' not `len'.

2001-08-07  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

2001-08-04  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Don't rely on M4sugar outputting the patterns in files, since we
	might process the output _without_ running m4, hence without these
	files.

	* lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_init): No need for `m4_tmpdir'.
	* bin/autom4te.in (@Request::includes): Remove, unused.
	(@Request::source): Rename as...
	(@Request::input): this.
	(@preselect): Add `m4_pattern_forbid' and `m4_pattern_allow'.

	`$forbidden' and `$allowed' are constant: use m//o.
	(&handle_m4): M4sugar no longer wants `m4_tmpdir'.
	(m4_pattern_forbid, m4_pattern_allow): Adjust for tracing only.

2001-08-04  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	`autoconf && autoheader' is sped up.  Now, speed up `autoheader &&
	autoconf', i.e., in addition to caching traces, cache the output.

	(Request::id): this.
	($cache, $icache, $tcache, $ocache): New.

	(&parse_args): The first file only can be frozen.

2001-08-04  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Don't let autom4te compute the `include' traces several times:
	first check that the trace cache file is up to date, and then
	compare its timestamp with that of the output.

	* bin/autom4te.in, bin/autoupdate.in, bin/autoscan.in: Normalize
	the preamble.  Don't require 5.005 as Autom4te::General does it,
	and better yet (use `use', not `require'!).
	* lib/Autom4te/Struct.pm: Rename the last occurrences of
	Class::Struct as Autom4te::Struct.
	* lib/Autom4te/General.pm (File::stat): Use it.
