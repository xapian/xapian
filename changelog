xapian-core (1.2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Drop quilt dependencies now we're using source format "3.0 (quilt)".
  * On i386 and *-i386, build both SSE2 and i386 versions of the library.  The
    main motivation is correctness (upstream now defaults to using SSE because
    excess precision from 387 FP instructions can cause inconsistencies in
    weight calculations) but the SSE2 build is faster too (~6%).
  * debian/rules: Try re-enabling optimisation on alpha - it's been more
    than a year.
  * debian/patches: All patches incorporated upstream, so remove.

xapian-core (1.1.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/runtest-no-fd-ulimit.patch: Drop patch - upstream now has
    fd leak checking in the test harness and has removed the ulimit.
  * debian/control.in:
    + Drop conflict on libxapian2 as that's too ancient to be relevant now.
    + Just use ${binary:Version} - sarge has reached EOL and I'm not intending
      to backport 1.1.x to dapper.
    + Add uuid-dev as a build dependency.

xapian-core (1.0.16-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The lsof probing reveals that the fd ulimit problem isn't due to extra
    fds being open, so remove it as it has served its purpose, and instead
    just disable the fd ulimit for now.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Mon, 14 Sep 2009 06:19:30 +0100

    the build from timing out.
  * debian/README.source: Added.
  * debian/patches: Replace the patch to disable the fd ulimit on alpha with
    one to use lsof to report and count the number of already open fds, and
    then add this number to the limit we were going to set.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sat, 12 Sep 2009 14:18:31 +0100

xapian-core (1.0.15-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Include /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make much earlier so that
    QUILT_STAMPFN is actually set when we try to use it.  This means that
    the patch(es) will actually be applied (presumably 1.0.14-2 built on
    alpha just by luck).
  * debian/rules: Build with "-g" so that the -dbg package is more useful.
  * debian/rules: Disable optimisation for avr32 in the hope that will avoid
    the build failing with "Took too long".
  * debian/rules: Add -ffloat-store for i386-hurd to try to get topercent2 to
    pass.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri, 28 Aug 2009 05:09:14 +0000

xapian-core (1.0.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * xapian-tools now depends on the same version of libxapian15 to avoid
    problems with some undocumented symbols xapian-compact uses.
  * Fix typo in package description.
  * debian/rules: Set DEB_HOST_ARCH by calling dpkg-architecture if it isn't
    already set so that behaviour is the same when running debian/rules "by
    hand".
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.8.3 (no changes required).
  * debian/patches/runtest-no-fd-ulimit-on-alpha.patch: Add a description of
    the patch.

xapian-core (1.0.14-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * "urgency=medium" as 1.0.14-1 has aged 5 days and only FTBFS on alpha
    because of a new ulimit in the testsuite in 1.0.14-1.
  * debian/rules,debian/control.in,debian/patches/series: Add support for
    managing patches with quilt, but only add quilt as a build dependency
    if there are patches.  Also autogenerate the versioned dependency on
    debhelper using debian/compat.
  * debian/patches/runtest-no-fd-ulimit-on-alpha.patch: Fix FTBFS on alpha
    by disabling the new fd ulimit in the test harness on that architecture.

  * debian/control.in: Update required debhelper version.
  * debian/copyright: Update for the MIT/X relicensing of the serialise-double
    code.
  * debian/rules: Explicitly disable use of valgrind for the testsuite -
    otherwise if someone builds their own package with valgrind installed (as
    developer boxes often do), the test suite run will take a really long
    time.

xapian-core (1.0.13-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patch: Backport more testsuite patches from upstream SVN:
    + Don't bother trying to count CPU time for child processes, as it's hard
      to ensure that the child processes have finished with the current
      framework, and just counting time in the current process checks most
      things (the local backend tests cover much of the work done by the
      server part of the remote backend).
    + Increase the number of tests until the first sample takes more than
      0.001 seconds to avoid trying to base calculations on a length of time
      we probably can't reliably measure to start with.
    + Always give the full exception message (was conditional on --verbose).
      Tidy up output for reporting the various different exception types and
      other failures to give more consistent output.

xapian-core (1.0.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patch: Backport two patches from upstream SVN:
    + Fix failure of topercent2 on some architectures.
    + Fix leaking of fds used to launch xapian-tcpsrv for remotetcp test,
      which hopefully will cure sporadic test failures on some buildds.
  * debian/rules: Reenable testsuite on m68k now that topercent2 should pass
    reliably.
  * debian/rules: Improve comment describing why we disable optimisation on
    alpha.

    libs.
  * debian/copyright: Update for 2009.  /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL ->
    /usr/share/licenses/GPL-2 since the former is now a symlink to GPL-3
    and Xapian is GPL v2 or later.
  * debian/patch: Patch from upstream SVN to fix equality test of const char *
    with string literal to use strcmp().

  * debian/control.in,debian/rules: Split off debug information into a new

  * debian/control.in: Update libxapian15 to "Priority: important" to match

xapian-core (1.0.7-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patch: Backport fix from upstream SVN which fixes segfaults when
    using OP_ELITE_SET on x86 and possibly m68k due to excess precision
    causing a comparison operator to report true for both a>b and b>a.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Thu, 09 Oct 2008 12:58:25 +0100

xapian-core (1.0.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Run "make all" and "make check" as separate commands to
    avoid hitting parallel building bugs.  Closes: #493390
  * debian/patch: Backport fixes for upstream bug #287 (which can cause
    database corruption), and a bug without a ticket which causes problems
    iterating over tables created lazily after the database has had commits
    which are still in sequential mode.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri,  8 Aug 2008 09:46:20 +0100

xapian-core (1.0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Fix configure and build rules to be parallel make safe
    (caused FTBFS on s390 buildd).
  * debian/rules: Temporarily disable the testsuite on m68k while we resolve
    why topercent2 is failing there.  It's a new regression test for a minor
    bug supposedly fixed in 1.0.7, so it's not like it actually worked any
    better in the currently installed 1.0.5-1 packages.

xapian-core (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Add "nl" for selecting the Dutch stemmer, which was accidentally missing
      from the list of language codes recognised.  Reported by Joey Hess.
      Closes: #484458
  * debian/copyright: Update for 2008 and a few other minor changes.
  * debian/control.in: Add "${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}" to "Depends"
    to fix a policy violation (dependencies will pull them in anyway so this
    hasn't caused problems in practice).  Omission noticed by Niko Tyni.
  * debian/control.in: Move libxapianNN-dev from "Depends" to "Recommends"
    for xapian-examples since it's not actually needed to run the built
    examples.
  * debian/rules: Add support for parallel=<n> in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, as
    recommended by policy 3.8.0.  Use $(filter ...) instead of $(find ...)
    to check for noopt in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to avoid false matches on
    substrings of non-standard options (e.g. snooptables).
  * debian/rules: Run the xapian-core testsuite unless nocheck is specified
    in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  It takes 3.5 minutes on x86-64, so hopefully
    shouldn't be too painful for slower architectures.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.8.0
  * debian/watch: Add watch file.  Not useful for me as I make the upstream
    releases, but DEHS, etc find it useful.
  * debian/xapian-doc.doc-base.apidocs: Section "Apps/Programming" is no
    longer valid - use section "Programming/C++" instead.
  * debian/xapian-doc.doc-base.xapian-intro: Section "Apps/Programming" is no
    longer valid - use section "Programming" instead.

  * debian/rules: Look for "CODENAME" and "debian/codename" rather than
    "COMPONENT" and "debian/component".

    databases.
  * debian/copyright: Update.
  * debian/rules: We don't need to pass --mandir or --infodir to configure

    have any documentation in "info" format).
  * debian/control.in: Add "zlib1g-dev" to "Build-Depends:".

  * New upstream release.

xapian-core (0.8.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make libxapian3 conflict with libxapian2, because libxapian2 version
    0.8.1-1 actually contained libxapian.so.3 (which was a bug).

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Tue, 14 Sep 2004 17:34:43 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops - library version number should be 3.  Changed it back,
    so we now have libxapian3.
    (I was confused between the interface number and the version number.)

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Tue, 14 Sep 2004 16:44:37 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (0.8.2).
  * library version number increased to 4 (from 2).
    (Xapian::Database::get_lastdocid added; QueryParser tries
    reparsing after stripping punctuation; several unused
    Error subclasses removed; assorted Iterator changes,
    Xapian::ESet::back and many other methods added).

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Tue, 14 Sep 2004 01:03:49 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

xapian-core (0.8.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove build dependencies on tools which aren't required if not using
    maintainer mode.

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 19 May 2004 13:33:02 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Perform build in a subdirectory.  This is neater, and will also make it
    easier to perform a differently configured build to produce a debug
    version.

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 19 May 2004 12:13:45 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules,debian/control.in: Remove queryparser packages - merge
    them into the main library package.

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 19 May 2004 01:44:58 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Add --list-missing back to dh_install.
  * debian/control.in: Remove build depend on graphviz, and add TODO item
    to sort this out properly.
    Also, build depend on debhelper >= 4.1.22, since this is needed for
    --list-missing.
  
 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 12 May 2004 11:59:42 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * xapian-doc: Correct Recommends field to point to libxapian-dev, not
    libxapian2-dev, and to libxapian-queryparser-dev not
    libxapian-queryparser1-dev.

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 12 May 2004 10:36:16 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove empty maintainer scripts, allowing debhelper to make them.
  * Add rules to make symlinks to config.guess and config.sub, and added
    Build-Depends on autotools-dev.  Remove Build-Depends on automake,
    autoconf and libtool (these will be run before the source package is
    generated).
  * Add some more items to TODO list.

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 12 May 2004 09:48:34 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed postinst, postrm, and prerm scripts to have a #!/bin/sh line, so
    they actually work.
  * Various tweaks to debian/rules suggested by looking at dh_make output. 

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Tue, 11 May 2004 17:00:03 +0100

xapian-core (0.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release, from upstream source snapshot.
