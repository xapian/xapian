    because of the new libmagic-dev B-D.
  * debian/xapian-omega.postinst,debian/xapian-omega.postrm: Use "set -e"

xapian-omega (1.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

xapian-omega (1.0.10-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules,debian/control.in: Dapper's automake is 1.4, but "automake
    (>= 1.10) | automake1.9" doesn't work in the Ubuntu dapper PPA builder -
    it has automake 1.4 installed, so goes for the first alternative, and then
    fails the version check.  We want to prefer 1.10 so swapping the order is
    no help, so generate the dependency depending on the codename.

    the test programs with libxapian.

xapian-omega (1.0.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

xapian-omega (1.0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in,debian/rules: Suggest ghostscript instead of gs-common

xapian-omega (1.0.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

    avoid hitting parallel building bugs.  Related to #493390 and
    #494247.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri,  8 Aug 2008 08:23:01 +0100

xapian-omega (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Overhaul the $highlight colour combinations since some were rather
      unreadable.  Reported by Joey Hess.  Closes: #484456
  * debian/copyright: Update for 2008 and a few other minor changes.
  * debian/control.in: Add "djvulibre-bin" to "Suggests:" as omindex can now
    make use of it to index DjVu files.
  * debian/rules: The dependency on libxapianN is now versioned.  We require a
    version >= the version of xapian-omega being packaged (which is sometimes
    slightly too conservative, but simple to implement without manual
    maintenance).
  * debian/rules: Add support for parallel=<n> in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, as
    recommended by policy 3.8.0.  Use $(filter ...) instead of $(find ...)
    to check for noopt in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to avoid false matches on
    substrings of non-standard options (e.g. snooptables).
  * debian/rules: Run the xapian-omega testsuite unless nocheck is specified
    in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  Takes less than a second to run on x86-64.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.8.0
  * debian/watch: Add watch file.  Not useful for me as I make the upstream
    releases, but DEHS, etc find it useful.
  * debian/rules: Calculate the version starting the next release branch (so
    1.1.0 currently) and use that as the upper bound on the libxapian-dev
    build dependency).
  * debian/control.in,debian/rules: Depend on the autotools and run autoreconf
    so we're using Debian's patched libtool which avoids trying to explicitly
    link with -lz.  Specify --mandir=/usr/share/man to configure since in the
    dapper backport the newest automake available is 1.9 which defaults mandir
    to /usr/man.

    + omindex now accepts '-f' as documented.  Closes: #455526.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes required).
  * debian/control.in: Remove "perl" from "Suggests:" as perl is
    "Priority: essential".  Policy section 3.5 says that such dependencies
    should be avoided.
  * debian/xapian-omega.prerm,debian/xapian-omega.postrm: prerm doesn't get
    the "purge" action, so replace the prerm with a postrm so templates get
    removed on purge.  Closes: #455103
  * debian/control.in: The "Homepage:" header is now official, so convert
    "Homepage:" pseudo-header.

xapian-omega (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Now builds with GCC 4.3 snapshot.  Closes: #417767
  * debian/control.in: Update "Suggests:" for changes in omindex: change
    pstotext to gs-common since omindex now indexes PostScript by converting
    it to PDF first since that appears to be the only way to handle PostScript
    containing non-latin1 characters; add libwps-tools for MS Works documents.
  * debian/copyright: Update.
  * debian/rules: We don't need to pass --mandir or --infodir to configure
    as the values we explicitly set are the defaults anyway (and we don't
    have any documentation in "info" format).
  * debian/patch: Include patch from Xapian SVN to fix a small (and
    long-standing - this dates back to at least Omega 0.8.2) issue in the HTML
    parser to do with handling tags with only whitespace between them.
  * debian/rules: Install the new "templates/inc" subdirectory and its
    contents.
  * debian/xapian-omega.install: The documentation is now installed in the
    directory we want it in by default - we no longer need to move it.  Also
    the path where the omega CGI binary is installed by default has changed.

  * Suggest libwpd7, which is actually present in testing and unstable,
    rather than libwpd, which isn't.

xapian-omega (0.8.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge xapian-omega and xapian-scriptindex packages, to reduce complexity
    of maintainance, and also because there is a slight possibility of them
    being merged in future.  (It is tidier not to have to merge packages
    after we've officially released them).
