	- Add wrappers for Query::MatchAll and Query::MatchNothing.
	- Don't pointlessly reinitialise default std::string parameters to an

1.2.5.0  Mon Apr  4 14:00:38 UTC 2011
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- simpleindex.pl - use 'while' to loop over input lines - 'foreach'
	  reads them all in and then loops over them, while reads and processes
	  line by line.
	- Add '1;' to the end of t/symbol-test/SymbolTest.pm.

1.2.4.0  Thu Dec 19 12:41:49 UTC 2010
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Xapian exceptions were still being thrown as strings in Perl in
	  some cases.  Now all cases throw a subclass of Search::Xapian::Error.
	  For compatibility with code which expects the previous behaviour
	  these subclasses auto-stringify to the string which would have been
	  thrown before.
	- Make sure all Perl files have 'use strict;' and 'use warnings;'.
	- Remove superfluous 'use Carp;' from generated error classes.
	- t/document.t,t/index.t,t/search.t: Test TermIterator::get_termname().
	- Makefile.PL now looks for CXXFLAGS and CPPFLAGS passed on the
	  command line, and adds them to CCFLAGS in the generated Makefile.
	[Changes contributed by Tim Brody]
	- New testcase t/10query.t.
	[Changes contributed by David F. Skoll and Dave O'Neill]
	- Tell DynaLoader to load the module with RTLD_GLOBAL so exceptions
	  still work when multiple Perl modules which link to xapian-core are
	  loaded.  (ticket#522)

1.2.3.0  Tue Aug 24 06:03:12 UTC 2010
	[Changes contributed by Tim Brody]
	- Allow user-specified ExpandDecider to be specified to get_eset().

	- Fix bogus "can't find libtool" error when rerunning Makefile.PL and
	  XAPIAN_CONFIG isn't explicitly specified.

1.2.2.0  Sun Jun 27 03:31:36 UTC 2010
	- No change except for bumping the version to indicate compatibility
	  with Xapian 1.2.2.

1.2.1.0  Tue Jun 22 14:48:00 UTC 2010
	- No change except for bumping the version to indicate compatibility
	  with Xapian 1.2.1.

	[This release includes all changes from 1.0.15-17 which are relevant.]
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Wrap new Xapian::SerialisationError class.
	- Ship simplematchdecider.pl example, which was added in 1.0.13.1 but
	  accidentally not added to 1.1.1.0.
	- Work around odd rerunning of Makefile.PL by MakeMaker when srcdir !=
	  builddir.

1.1.2.0  Thu Jul 23 04:14:29 UTC 2009
	[This release includes all changes from 1.0.14 which are relevant.]

1.1.1.0  Tue Jun  9 13:22:07 UTC 2009
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Add Search::Xapian::MSet::items() method which returns an array
	  tied to the MSet (much like Search::Xapian::Enquire::matches(), but
	  you get easy access to the MSet object itself too).
	- Add the ability to tie an ESet to an array and a new
	  Search::Xapian::ESet::items() method to make use of it.
	- Add new translated version of the simple examples from the Python
	  bindings.
	- Add more fully featured examples: full-indexer.pl and
	  full-searcher.pl.
	- Add better test coverage for MatchDecider.
	- Catch C++ exceptions from methods of Document and rethrow as Perl
	  exceptions (ticket#284).
	- Add dependency to regenerate Makefile if Xapian.pm changes (since the
	  former contains a version number extracted from the latter).

1.1.0.0  Thu Apr 22 13:56:31 GMT 2009
	[Changes contributed by Andreas Marienborg and Olly Betts]
	- Xapian C++ exceptions classes are now wrapped and C++ exceptions
	  are caught and rethrown in Perl as the wrapped classes.
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Xapian-core now uses libtool 2.2.x, which has required changes to
	  the how we cram libtool into the MakeMaker-generated Makefile.
	  However, there's still a wrinkle in this change - you can't currently
	  run "make install" in a tree configured to use an uninstalled
	  xapian-core.

1.0.23.0  Fri Jan 14 04:18:24 UTC 2011
	[Changes contributed by David F. Skoll and Dave O'Neill]
	- Tell DynaLoader to load the module with RTLD_GLOBAL so exceptions
	  still work when multiple Perl modules which link to xapian-core are
	  loaded (ticket#522).

1.0.22.0  Sun Oct  3 12:36:44 UTC 2010
	[Changes contributed by Jess Robinson]
	- Fix bogus "can't find libtool" error when rerunning Makefile.PL and
	  XAPIAN_CONFIG isn't explicitly specified.
	[Changes contributed by Tim Brody]
	- New testcase t/10query.t.

1.0.21.0  Fri Jun 18 16:41:32 UTC 2010
	- No change except for bumping the version to indicate compatibility
	  with Xapian 1.0.21.

1.0.20.0  Tue Apr 27 12:35:35 UTC 2010
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Avoid importing isa from UNIVERSAL to fix Perl 5.12 deprecation
	  warning (Debian bug#578559).
	- Fix testcase t/04functions.t to work with Perl compiled with
	  -Duselongdouble (Debian bug#578558).

	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Wrap Document::add_boolean_term() (new in C++ API in 1.0.18).
	- Add test coverage for Document::remove_term().

1.0.18.0  Sun Feb 14 10:22:53 UTC 2010
	[Changes contributed by Henry Combrinck]
	- Add wrappers for the spelling correction functionality (ticket#420).

1.0.17.0  Wed Nov 18 02:02:41 UTC 2009
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Fix to build with compilers other than GCC by disabling Perl's
	  #define for bool.  (ticket#404)

1.0.16.0  Thu Sep 10 06:26:08 UTC 2009
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Improve documentation of QueryParser::set_default_op() and
	  QueryParser::get_default_op().
	- examples/: Use MSet::items() (new in 1.0.13.1).
	- examples/simpleexpand.pl: Remove debug print statement left in by
	  accident.
	- Add dependency to regenerate Makefile if Xapian.pm changes (since the
	  former contains a version number extracted from the latter).
	- Add better test coverage for MatchDecider.

1.0.15.0  Wed Aug 26 14:59:31 GMT 2009
	[Changes contributed by Frank Lichtenheld]
	- Run POD coverage tests if TEST_POD_COVERAGE is set rather than
	  TEST_POD so that the other POD tests can easily be enabled without
	  enabling the coverage tests.

1.0.14.0  Tue Jul 21 16:10:19 GMT 2009
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Add handling of C++ exceptions from methods of Document (ticket#284).

1.0.13.1  Tue May 26 13:51:18 GMT 2009
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Deprecate Search::Xapian::MSet::matches() and make it issue a
	  warning.  Please use Search::Xapian::MSet::items() instead.
	- Add another translated example: simplematchdecider.pl

1.0.13.0  Sat May 23 15:10:39 GMT 2009
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Add Search::Xapian::MSet::matches() method which returns an array
	  tied to the MSet (much like Search::Xapian::Enquire::matches(), but
	  you get access to the MSet object itself).
	- Add new translated version of the simple examples from the Python
	  bindings.
	- Add more fully featured examples: full-indexer.pl and
	  full-searcher.pl.

1.0.12.0  Sun Apr 19 11:18:04 GMT 2009
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Add handling of exceptions from Database::get_metadata() and methods
	  of Enquire which might throw DatabaseModifiedError to address
	  situation reported in ticket#284.
	- Skip thread.t testcase if Perl is new enough, but wasn't built with
	  thread support (reported by Felix Antonius Wilhelm Ostmann).
	- Fix "fake VPATH" mode to work better.
	[Changes contributed by Kosei Moriyama]
	- Add test coverage for more WritableDatabase methods.

1.0.11.0  Sun Mar 15 12:53:20 GMT 2009
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Wrap the new FLAG_DEFAULT constant which gives the QueryParser
	  default flag settings, allowing you to easily add flags to the
	  default ones.

1.0.10.0  Tue Dec 23 09:18:21 GMT 2008
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Makefile.PL now supports a "fake VPATH" mode, to better support for
	  building from SVN.  If you run "perl /path/to/Makefile.PL" then
	  Makefile.PL will run Makefile.PL as nomal in /path/to, and then
	  create a stub Makefile in the current directory which forwards any
	  make invocations.

1.0.9.0  Fri Oct 31 23:27:06 GMT 2008
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Wrap Search::Xapian::get_major_version(), get_minor_version(),
	  get_revision(), sortable_serialise(), and sortable_unserialise().
	- Reject xapian-core < 1.0 with an error rather than just a warning.

1.0.8.0  Thu Sep  4 05:38:22 GMT 2008
	- No change except for bumping the version to indicate compatibility
	  with Xapian 1.0.8.

1.0.7.0  Thu Jul 17 00:18:17 GMT 2008
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Handle exceptions from Xapian::Stem constructor (reported by Joey
	  Hess in Debian BTS #486138).
	- Fix testcase in t/parser.t for improved behaviour of xapian-core.
	- Actually fill in @Search::Xapian::DB_NAMES.
	- Search::Xapian::Query->new(<OP>, <TERMS>) now allows integers and
	  numbers as terms - these are coerced to strings as with standard
	  Perl parameter passing.

1.0.6.0  Sun Mar 30 10:20:58 GMT 2008
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- If the Search::Xapian and xapian-config versions don't match, and
	  $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} is true, then we need to unlink Makefile as
	  well as exiting with status 0.
	- Mention QueryParser flags in POD: FLAG_SPELLING_CORRECTION,
	  FLAG_SYNONYM, FLAG_AUTO_SYNONYMS, and FLAG_AUTO_MULTIWORD_SYNONYMS.
	- Removed no-op method Enquire::register_match_decider() which is now
	  deprecated in C++.  It doesn't do anything, and never has, so if
	  you were calling it, you can just remove the call!
	- Improve POD for Enquire::get_eset().
	- Increment the reference counts of Sorter objects passed to methods
	  of Enquire.  This means we'll leak them, but that's better than
	  having them garbage collected while the C++ code is still using them.
	  This will be fixed properly in a future release.
	- You can now construct a Query from a mixed list of Query objects and
	  strings (previously the list had to be all Query objects or all
	  strings).
	- Don't accept values with a leading '-' or '+' for OP_* constants -
	  users should be using the defined constants for these which are all
	  positive without an explicit '+'.
	- Wrap OP_SCALE_WEIGHT, OP_VALUE_GE, OP_VALUE_LE, and the corresponding
	  Query constructor overloads.
	[Changes contributed by Matthew Somerville]
	- Wrap optional prefix argument to WritableDatabase::allterms_begin()
	  and WritableDatabase::allterms_end().

1.0.5.0  Wed Jan 02 01:07:28 GMT 2008
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Suppress MakeMaker warnings if CXX and/or XAPIAN_CONFIG are
	  specified.
	- If CXX and/or XAPIAN_CONFIG are specified in the environment, we
	  make sure that they are preserved in Makefile.PL is rerun.
	- If xapian-config isn't found, Makefile.PL now exits with status 0
	  which CPAN tester script understand to mean "missing dependencies".
	- If the Search::Xapian and xapian-config versions don't match, the
	  usual warning is replaced by an error and exit with status 0 if
	  $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} is true.
	- Emphasise in the README and POD that bug reports should be sent to
	  the xapian-discuss mailing list or Xapian bug tracker, not to the
	  CPAN bug tracker or individual authors.
	- "use Exporter 'import';" rather than inheriting from Exporter to
	  avoid pulling other symbols in.
	- Rejig the constructors of the ValueRangeProcessor subclasses so that
	  they should work with Perl 5.6 too.
	- Wrap MultiValueSorter and Enquire::set_sort_by_key(), etc.
	- Minor documentation improvements.
	- Enhance t/parser.t to check results of NumberValueRangeProcessor.
	- Fix QueryParser::parse_query() to catch Xapian::Error rather than
	  const char * - it stopped throwing const char * in Xapian 1.0.0
	  (bug#221).
	- Wrap TermGenerator methods: set_database() and set_flags().
	[Changes contributed by Rusty Conover]
	- Wrap QueryParser flags: FLAG_SPELLING_CORRECTION, FLAG_SYNONYM,
	  FLAG_AUTO_SYNONYMS, and FLAG_AUTO_MULTIWORD_SYNONYMS.
	- Wrap WritableDatabase methods: add_synonym(), remove_synonym(), and
	  clear_synonyms().
	- Wrap TermGenerator::FLAG_SPELLING and TermGenerator::set_database().

1.0.4.0  Wed Oct 31 23:18:02 GMT 2007
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Add all the POD pages to the "see also" on the main POD page.
	- Fix typos and improve wording throughout the POD documentation.
	- Add POD documentation for ValueIterator.
	- Makefile.PL now accepts XAPIAN_CONFIG and CXX on the command line
	  (like autoconf configure scripts) and values specified here are
	  persistent across automatic reruns, so promote this usage over
	  environmental variables.
	- Compiling with GCC 4.2 gives many "deprecated conversion from string
	  constant to 'char*'" warnings.  Most are from XS-generated code, but
	  fix the small number which aren't.
	- Make Search::Xapian work with 'use threads;' by adding 'sub
	  CLONE_SKIP { 1 }' to all the classes (this requires Perl >= 5.8.7
	  to work, but has no effect on older versions).  Using CLONE_SKIP
	  means that Xapian objects aren't copied to subthreads, so the wrapped
	  C++ objects don't get destroyed more than once.  Thanks to Ron Kass
	  for suggesting this change.
	- Add testcase thread.t to check that threaded use works as expected
	  under Perl 5.8.7.
	- BoolWeight objects are now blessed as class BoolWeight rather than
	  class Weight.
	- Fix test parser.t to match the fixed behaviour of STEM_ALL.
	- Cleaned up unnecessary 'require Exporter;' and 'use Carp;'.
	- Move the POD documentation to the end of the pm files and insert
	  __END__ before them.
	- A script to generate interlinked HTML documentation has been added
	  (called makehtmldocs).

1.0.3.0  Sat Sep 29 13:26:32 BST 2007
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Wrap Database::get_metadata() and WritableDatabase::set_metadata().
	- Improve QueryParser pod documentation.
	- PerlStopper::operator() now declared const as it should be.
	- Suppress "deprecated" warnings from Xapian since we need to keep
	  wrapping deprecated features.
	- Suppress compilation warnings on some Linux distros.
	- Add Xapian.lo to MANIFEST.SKIP (it's generated if we're building
	  against an uninstalled xapian-core tree).
	[Changes contributed by Reini Urban]
	- Force LD to be "g++ -shared" for GCC on Cygwin since Perl < 5.9.5
	  Cygwin packages need it.

1.0.2.0  Thu Jul 05 15:44:03 BST 2007
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Disable NumberValueRangeProcessor tests, which need updating.

1.0.1.0  Sat Jun 16 00:49:33 BST 2007
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Wrap new optional prefix argument to Database::allterms_begin() and
	  Database::allterms_end().
	- Test Database::allterms_begin() in t/search.t.
	- Increment the reference counts of Stopper and ValueRangeProcessor
	  objects passed to methods of QueryParser and TermGenerator.  This
	  means we'll leak them, but that's better than having them garbage
	  collected while the C++ code is still using them.  This will be
	  fixed properly in a future release.

1.0.0.0  Sat May 26 00:41:07 BST 2007
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Wrap new TermGenerator class.
	- Wrap new QueryParser flags FLAG_PURE_NOT and FLAG_PARTIAL.
	- Wrap new Query op OP_VALUE_RANGE and associated constructor.
	- Wrap ValueRangeProcessor and subclasses, and
	  QueryParser::add_valuerangeprocessor().
	- Removed wrappers for deprecated features which have now been removed
	  from the C++ API.
	- Fix small memory leaks in various methods when the C++ method throws
	  an exception.
	- MSet::convert_to_percentage() now actually works (and added feature
	  tests to search.t to make sure it keeps working).
	- Test WritableDatabase::add_value() in t/index.t.
	- Test OP_VALUE_RANGE in new t/valuerange.t.
	- Test ValueRangeProcessor and subclasses in t/parser.t.
	- More tests for ESetIterator.
	- Feature tests for new TermGenerator class.
	- Add "make check" as an alias for "make test".

	  Enquire::matches()
	- Add tests for check_at_least and rset parameters of
	  Enquire::get_mset()
	- Avoid warning from MakeMaker when generating Makefile for linking
	  against an uninstalled xapian-core tree.
	- Correct several errors in the pod documentation for
	  Search::Xapian::PositionIterator.

0.9.9.1  Mon Dec 11 06:08:57 2006
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Fix typo in BoolWeight documentation.
	- Fix BoolWeight default constructor (broken by changes in 0.9.9.0).
	- Wrap TradWeight class.

0.9.9.0  Mon Nov 09 02:31:09 2006

	- Fix problem with isa not being known in Xapian::PostingIterator.
	- Wrap the newly implemented transaction API to WritableDatabase.

0.9.6.0  Sun Jun 04 01:14:00 2006
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
	- Alex's CPAN email address bounces, so change occurrences of it
	  to direct users to the xapian-discuss mailing list for now.
	- Correct several occurrences of "Xapian::Search::" to
	  "Search::Xapian::".
	- Wrap Enquire::set_docid_order (and document set_sort_forward
	  as deprecated.)
	- Wrap new method Enquire::set_sort_by_relevance_then_value.
	- Document Enquire::set_sort_by_* (and document set_sorting as
	  deprecated.)
	- Wrap the BM25Weight constructor which takes parameters
	  (the default one is much less useful, since Xapian defaults
	  to BM25Weight with the default parameters anyway!)
	- Wrap Enquire::set_sort_by_value_then_relevance()
	- Wrap the optional flags parameter to QueryParser::parse_query().
	- Disable the wrappers for the transaction API to WritableDatabase
	  - it's not implemented by any database backend yet, so it's not
	  useful to wrap it at present.
	- Fix PostingIterator != and == to handle both other PostingIterators
	  and numbers like PositionIterator does.
	- Wrap constants FLAG_BOOLEAN_ANY_CASE and FLAG_WILDCARD.
	- Fix typos and other problems in the POD documentation.  Document all
	  constants.
	- Update the list of unwrapped classes and methods.
	- Update the version in the README file.  Add code to Makefile.PL
	  to check that the various references to the current version are
	  all up-to-date.
	- Makefile.PL now refuses to proceed if it can't find Xapian.
	- Makefile.PL now checks that the Xapian version and Search::Xapian
	  version match, and if not issues a non-fatal warning (for now).
	- Makefile.PL now allows building against an uninstalled xapian-core
	  tree (which is useful when doing development work on Search::Xapian
	  itself).
	- Add feature test for Document::termlist_begin().

	- Add MANIFEST.SKIP to allow "make manifest".

0.9.2.4  Fri Feb 15 14:59:23 2006
	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts and Tim Brody]
	- Catch C++ exceptions from QueryParser and rethrow them as Perl
	  exceptions.
	- Makefile.PL now checks environmental variable CXX for the C++
	  compiler to use.
	- Fixed cross-wired methods inside Enquire::get_matching_terms_begin
	  and Enquire::get_matching_terms_end (thanks to Arne Georg Gleditsch
	  for reporting this).
	- $q = Query(op, @termlist) now handles terms with embedded zero bytes.
	- Removed Query::clone() and = overload - they would die if ever used
	  and aren't useful since a Query object is essentially immutable once
	  constructed.
	- Removed MSet::max_size - C++ only has it so MSet works as an STL
	  container.
	- RSet::size() returns doccount not termcount (though they're currently
	  the same type underneath so this is an aesthetic internal change).
	- Wrap most of the changed Xapian::QueryParser API.
	- Wrap new SimpleStopper class (with test cases).
	- Added PerlStopper class which can be subclassed in Perl to implement
	  your own stop word algorithm.
	- Wrap new Enquire sorting API methods.
	- Updated list of unwrapped classes and methods in documentation.
	- Make != and == work for comparing iterators (as well as ne and eq).

	  Document::add_term(), Document::remove_posting(),
	  Enquire::set_cutoff(), Enquire::set_sorting(), and
	  QueryParser::set_stemming_options().  Added test cases for
	  the first three.
	- Fixed wrapping of Enquire::get_matching_terms_begin() and
	  get_matching_terms_end().
	- Wrap versions of RSet::add_document(), RSet::remove_document(), and

	- Fixed MSet::convert_to_percent() to actually return a value!
	- Wrap missing MSetIterator methods: --, get_collapse_count().

	- Cleaned up wrapping of ++ methods for all iterators.
	- Wrap missing ESet methods: back().
	- Fixed wrapping of ESetIterator methods: ==, !=.
	- Wrap 3 argument form of Enquire::set_sorting().

	- Second argument to QueryParser::set_stemming_options() may now be
	  omitted.
	- Wrap ValueIterator class.
