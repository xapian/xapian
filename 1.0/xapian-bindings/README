See INSTALL for instructions on configuring, building, and installing this
software.  See TODO for the to-do list.  See HACKING for information relevant
to anyone wanting to do development work on the bindings.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Most development work has been done on Linux with GCC, but the bindings should
work on other Unix-like platforms and with other compilers (we've heard success
stories for at least Mac OS X and OpenBSD, and the tinderbox builds pass "make
check" on FreeBSD and NetBSD).

The Python bindings have been successfully built on Microsoft Windows using
Mingw and MSVC: the PHP bindings have been successfully build on Microsoft
Windows using MSVC.  The other bindings may need a few build tweaks to work
- contact us via the mailing lists if you want to get them working.

Supported Languages
-------------------

Bindings for the following languages should be fully functional and ready
for real world use:

Java		Java bindings (built using JNI) contributed by Eric B. Ridge.
		See java/README for Java binding specific information.

Perl		Perl XS bindings contributed by Alex Bowley and co-maintained
	        by Olly Betts are available from CPAN (module Search::Xapian).

PHP		Requires PHP 4 or 5.

Python		Requires Python 2.2 or later.  Note that there is an issue
		involving using the xapian bindings with Apache's
		mod-python: be sure to read the documentation file for the
		python bindings (section "Apache and Mod-Python") if you're
		using mod-python.

Ruby		Requires Ruby 1.8 or later (brief tests show the bindings
		probably work with at least Ruby 1.6.8 too, but smoketest.rb
		doesn't because the test/unit module isn't available and
		apparently Ruby versions < 1.8 are no longer in common use).

Tcl		Requires Tcl 8.1 or later (Tcl 8.0 could be made to work
		without too much work).

C#		Tested with Mono C# 1.0.8 and 1.1.8 and Portable.NET 0.6.12.
		Also tested with Mono C# 1.2.3.1 - note that for Mono
		runtimes from 1.2 onwards, you need to compile with gmcs
		(instead of mcs) or you'll get segmentation faults at runtime.
		The configure script prefers to use gmcs if it is present, but
		you can run `./configure CSC=mcs' to force use of mcs even
		if gmcs is also installed.


If you're interest in getting other languages supported, see the "Adding
support for other programming languages" section in the file HACKING.
