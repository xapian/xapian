Welcome to the Xapian repository!
=================================

Xapian is split into several modules, which are held in sub-directories of
the directory containing this file.  The core code and documentation is in
the xapian-core module.

If you're new to hacking on Xapian, you should probably start by reading the
Xapian developer guide:

If you're new to Xapian entirely, you should probably read our user
guide, and then look for further information on our website at

Experimental: we have support for building an Ubuntu VM using Vagrant
and VirtualBox.  The command ``vagrant up`` will start the process, although
it can currently take a long time to download and install all the relevant
packages. See "Using a Vagrant-driven Ubuntu virtual machine" in
xapian-core/HACKING for details.
