Welcome to the Xapian subversion repository!
============================================

Xapian is split into several modules, which are held in sub-directories of
the directory containing this file.  The core code and documentation is in
the xapian-core module.

If you're new to hacking on Xapian, you should probably start by reading the
xapian-core/HACKING file.  If you're new to Xapian entirely, you should
probably read the xapian-core/README file, or you can find further information
on our website at http://xapian.org/
