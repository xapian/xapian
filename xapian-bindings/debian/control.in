Architecture: any
Depends: ${tcl:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Xapian search engine interface for Tcl
 This package provides Xapian Tcl bindings which should work with any version
 of Tcl >= 8.1 (by using Tcl's stubs mechanism.)
 .
 The Xapian search engine library is a highly adaptable toolkit to allow
 developers to easily add advanced indexing and search facilities to their own
 applications.  It implements the probabilistic model of information retrieval,
 and provides facilities for performing ranked free-text searches, relevance
 feedback, phrase searching, boolean searching, stemming, and simultaneous
 update and searching.  It is highly scalable, and is capable of working with
 collections containing hundreds of millions of documents.
 .
 The Xapian Tcl bindings provide an interface to the Xapian library from the
 Tcl programming language, allowing both indexing and retrieval operations.
