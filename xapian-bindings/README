See INSTALL for instructions on configuring, building, and installing this
software.  See TODO for the to-do list.  See HACKING for information relevant
to anyone wanting to do development work on the bindings.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Most development work has been done on Linux with GCC, but the bindings should
work on other Unix-like platforms and with other compilers (we've heard success
stories for at least Mac OS X >= 10.3 and OpenBSD, and the tinderbox builds
pass "make check" on FreeBSD and NetBSD).

The Python bindings have been successfully built on Microsoft Windows using
Mingw and MSVC: the PHP bindings have been successfully build on Microsoft
Windows using MSVC.  The other bindings may need a few build tweaks to work
- contact us via the mailing lists if you want to get them working.

Supported Languages
-------------------

Bindings for the following languages should be fully functional and ready
for real world use:

C#		Tested with Mono C# 2.6.7 recently.  Much older versions
		worked with Mono C# 1.0.8, 1.1.8, 1.2.3.1 and Portable.NET
		0.6.12.  For Mono runtimes from 1.2 onwards, you need to
		compile with gmcs (instead of mcs) or you'll get segmentation
		faults at runtime.  The configure script prefers to use gmcs if
		it is present, but you can run `./configure CSC=mcs' to force
		use of mcs even if gmcs is also installed.

Java		Java bindings (built using JNI) contributed by Eric B. Ridge.
		See java/README for Java binding specific information.

Lua		Requires Lua 5.1 or later; tested with 5.1 and 5.2.

Perl		Perl XS bindings contributed by Alex Bowley and co-maintained
		by Olly Betts are available from CPAN (module Search::Xapian).
		SWIG-based Perl bindings were implemented by Kosei Moriyama in
		GSoC 2009, and made their debut in the 1.2.4 release.  The
		intention is that these will replace the XS bindings in Xapian
		1.4.x.  The bindings here probably need Perl 5.8 or later.

PHP		Requires PHP 5 (PHP 4 is no longer supported by the PHP
		developers, so it doesn't make sense for us to continue to
		support it).  PHP7 is not yet supported (SWIG doesn't
		yet support it).

Python		Requires Python 2.3 or later (Python 3 isn't supported by
		Xapian 1.2.x, but there's support in development versions
		1.3.2 and later, which will be in stable release 1.4.0).
		If you still need support for Python 2.2, use Xapian 1.0.x.
		Note that you need to configure Apache's mod_python or mod_wsgi
		correctly to avoid deadlocks when using Xapian's Python
		bindings - be sure to read the "Apache and mod_python/mod_wsgi"
		section of the Python bindings documentation.

Ruby		Requires Ruby 1.8 or later.  With Ruby 1.9.0, the testsuite
		fails due to a bug in the test/unit module, but applications
		using the bindings should work fine.  With Ruby 1.9.1, the
		testsuite passes.  Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 also work with
		xapian-bindings >= 1.2.17 and xapian-bindings >= 1.3.2.

Tcl		Requires Tcl 8.1 or later (Tcl 8.0 could be made to work
		without too much work, but versions 8.3 and earlier are no
		longer supported by the Tcl developers, so it doesn't make
		sense for us to expend effort to support them).
