See INSTALL for instructions on configuring, building, and installing this
software.  See TODO for the to-do list.  See HACKING for information relevant
to anyone wanting to do development work on the bindings.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Most development work has been done on Linux with GCC, but the bindings should
work on other Unix-like platforms and with other compilers (we've heard success
stories for at least Mac OS X >= 10.3, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD).

The Python bindings have been successfully built on Microsoft Windows using
Mingw and MSVC: the PHP bindings have been successfully build on Microsoft
Windows using MSVC.  The other bindings may need a few build tweaks to work
- contact us via the mailing lists if you want to get them working.

Supported Languages
-------------------

Bindings for the following languages should be fully functional and ready
for real world use:

C#		Tested with Mono C# 3.0.6.0 and 4.2.1.0 recently.  Requires
		.NET 2 or later (because that's what SWIG supports).

Java		Java bindings are generated with SWIG as of Xapian 1.3.0.
		The current API should be regarded as experimental - we plan
		to review it, possibly make some changes and then declare it
		stable early in the 1.4.x release series.  The minimum Java
		version we aim to support is JDK 1.6 (Java 6).  Recently tested
		with OpenJDK 1.8.0_77, 1.7.0_03, and 1.6.0_38.

Lua		Requires Lua 5.1 or later; tested with 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.

Perl		These Perl bindings are generated by SWIG, and are intended
		to replace the hand-written Search::Xapian XS bindings.  They
		are largely compatible with Search::Xapian - see the
		"COMPATIBILITY" section in the Xapian module's POD docs for
		details.  These bindings probably need Perl 5.8.3 or later.
		Recently tested with 5.14.2, 5.22.1 and 5.30.0.

PHP 7.x		Requires PHP >= 7.0.

Python 2.x	No longer supported.  Xapian 1.4.x supports Python 2.6 and 2.7.

Python 3.x	Requires Python 3.3 or later.

Ruby		Requires Ruby 2.1 or later (older versions are no longer
		supported by the Ruby developers - if you still need support
		for older Ruby, Xapian 1.2.x supports Ruby 1.8 and later).

Tcl		Requires Tcl 8.5 or later (older versions are no longer
		supported by the Tcl developers, so it doesn't make sense for
		us to expend effort to support them).

support for other programming languages" section in the file HACKING.
