Omega 1.2.23 (2016-03-28):

documentation:

* Update links to Xapian website and trac to use https, which is now supported,
  thanks to James Aylett.

indexers:

* Fix HTML/XML entity decoding to be O(n) not O(n²) - processing HTML/XML with
  a lot of entities is now much faster.

templates:

* Remove unused country code to name maps.  These were intended as examples,
  but they aren't very useful as such, and really just bloat the templates
  needlessly.

Omega 1.2.22 (2015-12-29):

documentation:

* Stop maintaining ChangeLog files.  They make merging patches harder, and stop
  'git cherry-pick' from working as it should.  The git repo history should be
  sufficient for complying with GPLv2 2(a).

* Clarify help text for omindex --mime-type option.

* docs/omegascript.rst:

  + Fix documentation of $last to say it's the MSet index *one beyond* the end
    of the current page.  Reported by Andrew Chilton.

  + Clarify that $split and $substr work in bytes.  Previously we said
    "characters" which could be taken as meaning they work with UTF-8
    characters.

  + Update documentation for $filters - it was missing these CGI parameters
    from the list of those serialised: COLLAPSE, DOCIDORDER, SORT, SORTREVERSE,
    SORTAFTER

  + Explicitly note user can use $setmap to create their own maps.

* docs/overview.rst:

  + SVG extraction is built-in too.

  + Expand paragraph about command `false`.  Note the versions where explicit
    support was added, and that this will also work with any version on Unix,
    where `false` is a command.

  + Document `cdb_dir`.

* docs/cgiparams.rst: Document behaviour if xDB is not set.

* Change "characters" to "bytes" in a few places to clarify that we don't mean
  Unicode code points.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Add '--title-size' option.

  + Handle .oft the same way as .msg - it's some sort of template email, and
    has essentially the same format.

omega:

* Make $querydescription ensure the match has been run, so that it includes
  filters.

* Avoid $allterms, $cgilist, $filterterms and $terms being O(n²) in the number
  of items in the returned list.

* If xFILTERS is not set, don't force the first page as that's unhelpful if
  someone fails to set it in their template.

* When environment variable SERVER_PROTOCOL is set to INCLUDED (as it is when
  we're being included in a page), we already suppress the HTTP headers, but
  now we suppress the blank line after the header too.

* Support option flag_cjk_ngram if built against xapian-core >= 1.2.22.

testsuite:

* Add test coverage for parsing of HTML entities.

build system:

* Fix error reporting if PCRE isn't installed. Fixes #693, reported by lhz7370.

portability:

* Avoid warning when building with glibc >= 2.21.

* Don't provide our own implementation of sleep() under __WIN32__ if there
  already is one - mingw provides one, and in some situations it seems to clash
  with ours.  Reported to xapian-discuss by John Alveris.

* Stop trying to use O_STREAMING - the patch to implement it was never merged
  into the Linux kernel, and I can't find any evidence that other platforms
  implement it.  The constant value O_STREAMING used now seems to be used for
  the part of O_SYNC which isn't covered by O_DSYNC, which seems likely to hurt
  performance if anything.

Omega 1.2.21 (2015-05-20):

documentation:

* docs/overview.rst: Document 'E' prefixed boolean terms for filtering by
  extension (see #668, reported by bramvdh).

* docs/encodings.rst: Add a document about character encoding, as suggested by
  James Aylett in #550.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + outlookmsg2html: Fix handling of message/rfc822 subparts.

omega:

* $prettyurl now decodes valid UTF-8 sequences, and some additional ASCII
  characters in the path part: []@!$&'()*+.;= (Fixes #550 and #644, reported by
  catkin and terencz.)

* $prettyurl now leaves the query and fragment parts of the URL alone and won't
  decode an escaped "/" (omindex doesn't create URLs with any of these, so we
  only risk breaking other URLs which have them).

* Drop compilation date and time from output when run from the command line -
  they prevent reproducible builds and the version number is sufficient
  information.

templates:

* templates/query: When listing matching terms, don't make the commas italic.

* templates/query: Eliminate blank line before <html>.

* templates/xml: Add XML declaration.

* templates/godmode: Specify charset utf-8 in the content-type.

build system:

* Link test programs with libtool's '-no-install' or '-no-fast-install', like
  we already do in xapian-core, which means that libtool doesn't need to
  generate shell script wrappers for them on most platforms.

portability:

* Add spaces between literal strings and macros which expand to literal strings
  for C++11 compatibility.

* Remove 'register' as it's deprecated and clang spits out warnings because of
  that.  Any modern compiler likely just ignores it as an optimisation hint
  anyway.

Omega 1.2.20 (2015-03-04):

documentation:

* docs/cgiparams.rst: Improve wording of docs for SORT parameter.

* docs/omegascript.rst: Update documentation references to DATE1, DATE2, and
  DAYSMINUS which were renamed in 0.6.x and the compatibility aliases removed
  in 1.0.0.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Ignore extensions .msi and .msp, which are Microsoft installer files, but
    which libmagic sometimes incorrectly identifies as application/msword.

  + Interpret a command of "false" in "--filter" as meaning to ignore files
    with that MIME type.

omega:

* Handle CGI parameter [=0 as [=1.

templates:

* templates/xml: Update handling of DATE1, DATE2 and DAYSMINUS which were
  renamed in 0.6.x and the compatibility aliases removed in 1.0.0.

build system:

* configure: Use pkg-config in preference to determine flags needed to
  compile and link with PCRE, as this will just work when cross-compiling
  (at least under MXE).

* configure: Define MINGW_HAS_SECURE_API under mingw to get _putenv_s()
  declared in stdlib.h.

* Enable automake option 'subdir-objects' to avoid warning from newer automake.

portability:

* Avoid doing link tests with libmagic in configure as they fail on mingw due
  to not automatically picking up libraries which libmagic itself depends on.

Omega 1.2.19 (2014-10-21):

documentation:

* docs/overview.rst: Note that pdftotext is part of poppler as well as xpdf.
  (Noted by Paul Wise)

Omega 1.2.18 (2014-06-22):

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Work around libmagic returning a MIME content-type of "Composite Document
    File V2 Document[...]" or "application/CDFV2-corrupt" by returning a more
    suitable filetype based on looking at the file's extension.

  + The starting URL wasn't previously URL encoded.  In 1.3.2, this will be
    fixed by URL encoding it as we do for the rest of the path, for the 1.2
    branch we only URL encode it if it contains a character <= 31 or at least
    one of '#', '%', ':' or '?'.  This avoids a one-off reindex of every
    document in the database in cases which work OK in practice.

  + When we skip a file because it exceeds the configured size limit, include
    that size limit in the message.

omega:

* Add support for setting the query expansion scheme to use.

portability:

* Don't compile in unixperm.cc - it isn't currently used, and it fails to build
  with mingw.  (fixes #635, reported by Alexis Denis)

* Fix warning when built with GCC 4.7.2 using -Os.

* Removed unused inline function, fixing compiler warning.

Omega 1.2.17 (2014-01-29):

documentation:

* docs/overview.html: Add Abiword as an example use of --filter, based on patch
  from Frank J Bruzzaniti (fixes#383).

portability:

* Fix "no previous declaration" warning on platforms which don't have
  mkdtemp().

Omega 1.2.16 (2013-12-04):

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Fix off-by-one when finding documents to delete which would sometimes cause
    omindex to fail to delete documents from the database when they weren't
    refound during an index update.

  + Decode dates in xlsx files.

  + Ignore extensions 'adm', 'cur', and 'ico' by default.

  + Group-readable files which are owner-readable but not world-readable should
    still get a "readable by owner" term added.  Reported by Emmanuel Garette.

build system:

* Compress source tarballs with xz instead of gzip.

* configure: Sync compiler warning flag machinery against xapian-core.  The
  changes are special handling for clang, passing -fshow-column where
  supported, and handling for new warning flags in GCC 4.6 and 4.7.

Omega 1.2.15 (2013-04-16):

omega:

* Don't pointlessly link utf8convert.o into the omega CGI.

Omega 1.2.14 (2013-03-14):

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Correct "max" -> "min" when reserving space for shared strings in .xlsx
    files.  This just means we now reserve a more appropriate amount of space
    to start with.

  + Ignore .com files by default.

Omega 1.2.13 (2013-01-09):

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Extracting text using external filters now works for filenames containing a
    newline character - previously the newline got lost during escaping for the
    shell.

  + Fix segfault when -F option without a ':' is passed.

  + Skip a file if we get a read error while calculating the MD5 checksum (used
    for duplicate detection) - previously we used a checksum of the file up to
    that point.

  + Avoid rereading SVG and Atom files when we calculate their MD5 checksums.

  + Improvement --help output and man page, most notably:

    - Say explicitly that --sample-size accepts the same formats as --max-size.

    - Note default size limit on files to index is unlimited.

  + When generating a sample for a CSV file, limit the size we pre-allocate to
    the CSV file size if that's smaller than the requested sample size, in case
    the user sets that limit very high.

omega:

* Fix to decode %-encoded character at the end of the query string.

build system:

* INCLUDES is now deprecated in automake, so use AM_CPPFLAGS instead.

Omega 1.2.12 (2012-06-27):

No changes since 1.2.11 except to bump the version - this release was made to
fix an incorrect library version information update in xapian-core 1.2.11.

Omega 1.2.11 (2012-06-26):

indexers:

* Change HTML parser's handling of multiple <body> tags and of text outside of
  <body> to match the behaviour of modern web browsers.  (ticket#599)

* omindex:

  + Add command line option to control the size of the document sample stored.
    Patch from Mihai Bivol.

  + Rework .xlsx parsing to substitute the shared strings into the positions
    they are used in, so that the sample actually matches what appears in the
    spreadsheet, and to index calculated cell contents.

  + Improve handling of headers and footers in OpenDocument documents.

  + pdftotext outputs a formfeed between each page, which messes up our "empty
    body" check, so trim any trailing formfeeds before this check.

build system:

* Don't explicitly link indirect shared library dependencies on FreeBSD,
  OpenBSD, and Solaris.

Omega 1.2.10 (2012-05-09):

indexers:

* Add support for CDATA to HTML/XML parser.

* omindex:

  + Add --max-size option, based on patch from ndaley in ticket#587.

  + Add support for atom feed files, patch from Mihai Bivol in ticket#595.

  + If the document with the highest existing docid before the run was updated,
    we were reporting it as "added", but now we correctly report it as
    "updated".  (Backported from 1.3.0).

  + Catch and report std::exception explicitly, so failing to allocate memory
    is no longer reported as "Unknown exception".  (Backported from 1.3.0).

* scriptindex:

portability:

* Fix to build with GCC 4.7 by adding cast to rlim_t to fix error about C++11
  compatibility (reported by Gaurav Arora).

Omega 1.2.9 (2012-03-08):

documentation:

* docs/overview.html:

  + Document that libmagic is used to determine the MIME type if the extension
    isn't known.  Partly addresses ticket#569.

  + We now limit time as well as CPU and memory for external filters.

indexers:

* Our HTML parser now ignores sections bracketed by <!--UdmComment--> and
  <!--/UdmComment-->, like we already do for <!--htdig_noindex-->.

* omindex: Add more extensions to the default ignore list: bin dat db fon jar
  lnk pyc pyd pyo sqlite sqlite3 sqlite-journal tmp ttf

Omega 1.2.8 (2011-12-13):

documentation:

* scriptindex.cc: Add link to http://xapian.org/docs/omega/scriptindex.html to
  --help output (and so also to the man page which is generated from this).

* omegascript.html: Add note to discourage use of percentage scores.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + If we don't get any data from an external filter for 5 minutes, give up -
    it has probably ended up blocked indefinitely.

  + Improve --help output (and man page which is generated from it).  Closes
    bug#572.

* scriptindex:

  + If no rules are found in the index script, report an error and give up -
    this is inevitably the result of a mistake, and adding empty documents to
    the database isn't helpful.

omega:

  + Add new $prettyurl{} command which undoes RFC3986 URL escaping which
    doesn't affect semantics in practice.  Partly addresses ticket#550.

  + Replace URL decoder with new implementation which handles various corner
    cases better.  Fixes bug#578.

  + If CGI parameter P has trailing spaces, we now remove them all rather than
    leaving one.

templates:

* templates/query: HTML escape topterms.

* templates/godmode: HTML escape the contents of document values.

* templates/query: Don't show the percentage score in the default template.

testsuite:

* Add new urlenctest unit test of URL encoding and decoding.

portability:

* configure: Sync changes from xapian-core: Don't pass -Wshadow for GCC < 4.1;
  don't pass -Wstrict-null-sentinel for GCC 4.0.x; only enable symbol
  visibility on platforms where it is supported.

packaging:

* xapian-omega.spec: Package outlookmsg2html helper.

Omega 1.2.7 (2011-08-10):

documentation:

* docs/termprefixes.html: Document how to map a user prefix to multiple term
  prefixes.

* docs/overview.html: Improve documentation of htdig_noindex.

omega:

* Improve $version output from "Xapian - xapian-omega 1.2.7" to "xapian-omega
  1.2.7".

packaging:

* xapian-omega.spec: We're ABI compatible within a release series so make
  dependency on xapian-core-libs >= rather than =.

Omega 1.2.6 (2011-06-12):

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.html: Correct the documentation of the colours used by
  $highlight{}.

* docs/overview.html: Add using unoconv as more complex example of using
  --filter (ticket#324).

templates:

* templates/query:

  + Make search query input type=search.

  + Autofocus the search query input (using HTML autofocus attribute with
    Javascript fallback for older browsers).  (ticket#544)

portability:

* Fix a compiler warning.

Omega 1.2.5 (2011-04-04):

documentation:

* Add index page which links to all the other documentation pages.

* INSTALL: Copy new Multi-Arch section from xapian-core/INSTALL.  Replace VPATH
  section with better equivalent from Xapian-core/INSTALL.

* docs/omegascript.html: Minor improvements.

indexers:

* The HTML parser no longer uses an exception to signify it has finished in
  the normal case as exceptions are typically costly to handle.  In tests,
  this made omindex ~0.23% faster when indexing a lot of HTML files.

* omindex:

  + Add --ignore-exclusions option, which will index HTML files despite meta
    robots tags, etc - omindex is often used in environments where such
    exclusions aren't relevant.

  + Fix to compile with older versions of libmagic which don't have
    MAGIC_MIME_TYPE (e.g. on Ubuntu hardy).

  + Tell xls2csv to separate fields with spaces rather than commas, and not to
    quote them.  Fixes indexing of numeric fields, and means we don't need to
    use our CSV parser to get a sample.

  + Add whitespace between chunks of text extracted from Microsoft Office 2007
    formats to prevent words in adjacent chunks from being run together.

  + Encode reserved characters in URLs - links to files with names containing
    '#' and '?' now work.

  + Handle .xlr extension the same way as .xls (later Microsoft Works versions
    apparently produce such files which are really the same format).

  + Index filename extension with new standard prefix E.

  + Just report the mimetype as unknown instead of saying "unknown Office 2007
    MIME subtype".

  + Ignore *.css and *.js by default too.

  + Messages reporting skipping files are now more consistent and always report
    the filename.

  + New --empty-docs option to allow documents we extract no body text from to
    be indexed (existing behaviour), skipped, or reported and then indexed.

omega:

* Fix double Content-Type header in some error reporting situations (regression
  introduced in 1.2.4).

* Update $url's URL encoding to follow RFC3986.

* Allow QueryParser flags to be set from OmegaScript (ticket#418).  The
  FLAG_SPELLING_CORRECTION flag can now be set using
  $opt{flag_spelling_correction,1} - the old $opt{spelling,true} way to
  enable this flag still works, but it now deprecated.

templates:

* templates/emptydocs,templates/godmode,templates/opensearch,templates/query,
  templates/xml: Add missing escaping.  Some of these instances may allow
  cross-site scripting, so upgrading your templates is recommended, especially
  if you have any sensitive cookies set on the domain Omega is running on.

* templates/xml:

  + Try $field{caption} (which is what omindex sets) before $field{title} when
    getting a value for the hit tag's title attribute - this is consistent with
    how the query template gets the title.

  + Add new 'type' attribute which gives $field{type}.

  + Add 'DBSize' attribute to <result> element.

  + Fix double escaping of matching terms.  This is only likely to affect cases
    where a matching term contains '&'.

  + Remove support for undocumented HILITECLASS CGI variable.  There's no
    evidence I can find using Google code search or web search that this has
    been used anywhere, and it's difficult to handle escaping it properly in
    the face of all the ways it could reasonably be used.

portability:

* Fix to compile on Microsoft Windows (ticket#350).

Omega 1.2.4 (2010-12-19):

documentation:

* Minor documentation improvements.

indexers:

* Some iconv implementations (such as that on Mac OS X) don't handle many of
  the commonly seen mis-punctuated charset names (e.g. UTF16, UTF_16).  We now
  check for this if iconv fails, fix up the charset name, and retry.

* The built-in character encoding converter now handles spaces in charset
  names.

* Use O_NOATIME if available and either the file is owned by the current euid,
  or the current euid is 0 (i.e. we're running as root).  This avoids updating
  the access time of files we index which saves time.  Fixes ticket#222.

* Report get_description() for Xapian exceptions, which provides additional
  information above get_msg().

* Add boolean terms with add_boolean_term() so they get wdf of 0 and don't
  contribute to document length.

* omindex:

  + Escape wildcard patterns being passed to unzip - in the unlikely event that
    one of these matched files in or under the current directory, we might fail
    to extract all the files we wanted to.

  + Add explicit support for indexing CSV files (better samples than from
    using '-Mcsv:text/plain').

  + Add support for indexing .msg files from Microsoft Outlook (using the Perl
    module Email::Outlook::Message.  (ticket#334)

  + Improve --help for --mime-type option.

  + Optionally use libmagic to detect MIME types for files for which we have no
    extension mapping, which allows us to handle files with a misleading
    extension, or no extension at all.  (ticket#114)

  + Add new --filter option which allows the user to specify new filters
    provided they return UTF-8 text on stdout.

  + If a filter command isn't installed, previously we wouldn't try it again
    for the same file extension - now we won't try it again for the same
    mime-type.

  + Index the leafname of the file (without any extension) as extra keywords.

  + Extract author from HTML, OpenDocument, and PDF files.  Index it with an A
    prefix, and add it as a field.

  + Add support for indexing text and metadata from SVG files.

  + Extract metadata from Microsoft Office 2007 file formats.

  + Index text in headers and footers for .odt and .docx files.

  + Use the CSV parser to generate a nicer sample for files of type
    application/vnd.ms-excel.

  + Add support for indexing Debian and RPM package files (ticket#493).

  + Make the memory limit for filter processes the size of physical memory,
    which is a little less arbitrary than 7/8 of this value (ticket#424).

  + Under --duplicate=ignore, fix so that old documents which aren't seen get
    deleted, which wasn't implemented before (to suppress this deletion, pass
    -p as well).

  + Rename the short option for --version from -v to -V for consistency with
    scriptindex and many other packages, and to free up -v as the short option
    for --verbose.  For backward compatibility, "omindex -v" is handled
    specially and still reports the version.

  + Add --verbose option, and disable the less interesting output unless it is
    specified.

  + Deprecate "--preserve-nonduplicates" in favour of new long option
    "--no-delete" which does the same thing, but has a clearer name.

  + The deletion of documents pass at the end of indexing is now more
    efficient.  We track how many documents in the database we haven't seen so
    we can stop once we've found them all (a particularly big improvement if
    there are no documents to delete), and we now use a PostingIterator over
    all documents which avoids needing to catch an exception for every gap in
    the used document ids.

  + Quietly ignore files with mimetype set to "ignore".  The initial list of
    extensions set to ignore is: .a .dll .dylib .exe .lib .o .obj .so

  + Index file owner and read permissions, to allow finding documents with a
    particular owner, and so searches can be restricted to documents a user is
    able to read.

  + Add file size as a document value, so you can sort on it and filter by it.

* scriptindex:

  + Fix file descriptor leak if the LOADFILE action is used on something which
    isn't a file.

omega:

* Make sure we write out HTTP headers when reporting an error early on.

* Extend $field to take an optional DOCID argument, rather than always using
  the context from $hitlist.

* Add new $emptydocs command which returns a list of documents with doclength
  zero.

* Add support for size: range filtering.  Currently the end points of the range
  have to be specified in bytes (e.g. size:102400..204800 for 100-200KB).

templates:

* templates/emptydocs: New template which lists documents with doclength zero.

build system:

* configure: Probe for any options needed to enable large file support.
  Handling files >= 2GB isn't especially useful, but more importantly this is
  needed to allow omindex to index files on filing systems with 64 bit inodes
  on some platforms (e.g. 32-bit Linux).

* Use -no-undefined on platforms which need it to dynamically link such as
  cygwin (need to do this taken from ticket#282).

portability:

* Fix to compile with Sun C++.

Omega 1.2.3 (2010-08-24):

documentation:

* docs/termprefixes.html: Update "flint and quartz" to "flint and chert" as
  quartz is no longer supported.  Give exact term length limit for flint and
  chert.

packaging:

* xapian-omega.spec: Don't run autoreconf - it's no longer required.

Omega 1.2.2 (2010-06-27):

portability:

* Apply getopt portability fixes from xapian-core 1.2.0, fixing build failures
  on Mac OS X (and probably some other platforms with non-GNU getopt
  implementations). (ticket#469)

Omega 1.2.1 (2010-06-22):

This release includes all changes from 1.0.21 which are relevant.

Omega 1.2.0 (2010-04-28):

This release includes all changes from 1.0.20 which are relevant.

build system:

* configure: Tell libtool not to link in deplibs on platforms where we know
  they aren't needed.

* configure: On Linux, extract the library search path from ldconfig which
  gives us the default entries reliably.

Omega 1.1.5 (2010-04-15):

This release includes all changes from 1.0.19 which are relevant.

Omega 1.1.4 (2010-02-15):

This release includes all changes from 1.0.18 which are relevant.

omega:

* Use the optimised integer to string conversion routines from xapian-core.

Omega 1.1.3 (2009-11-18):

This release includes all changes from 1.0.15-1.0.17 which are relevant.

templates:

* templates/query: If JavaScript is available, convert $field{modtime} to a
  string on the client-side so that the timezone is correct.  If JavaScript
  isn't available, fall back to the existing behaviour of using UTC.
  (ticket#314)

build system:

* configure: Default to looking for xapian-config-1.1 unless XAPIAN_CONFIG is
  specified.

Omega 1.1.2 (2009-07-23):

This release includes all changes from 1.0.14 which are relevant.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Handle the "macroenabled" versions of MS Office 2007 files too
    (ticket#290).

  + Extract pptx notesSlides and comments, if present.  (ticket#290).

Omega 1.1.1 (2009-06-09):

This release includes all changes from 1.0.13 which are relevant.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Check the last modification time of files before reindexing (ticket#342).

  + Add "--spelling" option to index spelling correction data.

* scriptindex:

  + Add new "spell" action for indexing spelling correction data (ticket#296).

omega:

* Add $suggestion and $opt{spelling} to provide access to spelling correction
  (ticket#296).

* Add $opt{weighting} to allow the weighting scheme and parameters to be
  specified (ticket#298).

* If SERVER_PROTOCOL in the environment is set to INCLUDED, then our output is
  being included in another page (e.g. using SSI) so suppress the output of any
  HTTP headers.

templates:

* templates/query: Offer any spelling correction QueryParser gives.

build system:

* configure: Sync warning flags used with GCC with xapian-core apart from
  -Woverloaded-virtual which fires for MyHtmlParser::parse_html().  That
  probably should be tidied up at some point, but not right now.

Omega 1.1.0 (2009-04-23):

indexers:

* scriptindex:

  + Make deprecated "index=nopos" an error.

omega:

* New OmegaScript command $transform{} which performs regular expression
  substitutions using the PCRE library (which is now required to build Omega).
  (ticket#231)

build system:

* The build system is now bootstrapped with newer versions of autoconf and
  libtool which should produce smaller files and speed up configure and
  make.

Omega 1.0.23 (2011-01-14):

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Escape wildcard patterns being passed to unzip - in the unlikely event that
    one of these matched files in or under the current directory, we might fail
    to extract all the files we wanted to when indexing document formats like
    OpenDocument which use a zip file container.

  + The parser for OpenDocument metadata wasn't initialising its "state" field.
    Often you'd be lucky and it would be initialised to zero, but this could
    have caused misparsing of metadata in some cases.

* scriptindex: Fix file descriptor leak if the LOADFILE action is used on
  something that isn't a file.

* If fstat() fails when trying to load a file, preserve the errno value from
  the fstat call to report to the user.

portability:

* configure: Probe for any options needed to enable large file support.
  Handling files >= 2GB isn't especially useful, but more importantly this is
  needed to allow omindex to index files on filing systems with 64 bit inodes
  on some platforms (e.g. 32-bit Linux).

* Add -no-undefined to AM_LDFLAGS on platforms which need it to dynamically
  link such as cygwin (need to do this taken from ticket#282).

Omega 1.0.22 (2010-10-03):

portability:

* Fix to compile with Sun C++.

Omega 1.0.21 (2010-05-18):

portability:

* Fix build failure in freemem.cc on Microsoft Windows.

Omega 1.0.20 (2010-04-27):

portability:

* Fix build failure on Mac OS X and possibly some other platforms (regression
  caused by fix for getopt-related warnings on Cygwin in 1.0.19).

Omega 1.0.19 (2010-04-15):

portability:

* Fix getopt-related warning on Cygwin.

Omega 1.0.18 (2010-02-14):

indexers:

* Make the default charset "utf-8" not "UTF-8" as we lower case explicitly
  specified character sets to compare to see if we need to reparse.  Previously
  XML documents which explicitly specified their character set as UTF-8 would
  cause needless restart or the parser.

* omindex:

  + Increase the wdf boost for the document title from 2 to 5, since 2 isn't
    really enough.

* scriptindex:

  + Don't abort with "Unknown Exception" if indexing is disallowed or we hit
    </body> for a document which had an overridden character set.  Fixes
    ticket#410.

Omega 1.0.17 (2009-11-18):

indexers:

* omindex:

  + On Linux, change the memory limit on external filters to use _SC_PHYS_PAGES
    since _SC_AVPHYS_PAGES excludes pages used by the OS cache and so will
    often report a really low value.  Fixes Debian bug#548987 and ticket#358.

  + Fix likely crash when reading output from external filter program if read()
    is interrupted by a signal.

  + Fix potential crash when indexing PostScript files (fixed by using delete[]
    (not delete) for array allocated by new[]).

testsuite:

* utf8converttest: Charset "8859_1" isn't understood by Solaris libiconv, and
  isn't a standard charset name, so just test it when using our built-in
  converter and GNU libc.

portability:

* Fix build failure on Mac OS X 10.6.

* Also check for socketpair() in -lxnet if it isn't found without, which
  enables resource limits on external filter programs called by omindex on
  Solaris, and possibly some other platforms.  Fixes ticket#412.

Omega 1.0.16 (2009-09-10):

* omega: Fix cross-site scripting vulnerability in reporting of exceptions
  (CVE-2009-2947).

Omega 1.0.15 (2009-08-26):

general:

* omegascript.vim: The list of OmegaScript commands in the vim mode was rather
  out of date, and a few commands were misclassified.  Fix both problems and
  avoid future recurrences by automatically generating those lists from the
  command list in query.cc.

documentation:

* omegascript.html: Document that $date uses UTC.  (ticket#314)

templates:

* query: Link to "xapian.org" rather than "www.xapian.org".

* inc/toptermsjs: Use double-quotes rather than single quotes for parameter
  values on the <script> tag.

portability:

* omindex: Implement correct handling of paths when calling external filter
  programs on Microsoft Windows.

Omega 1.0.14 (2009-07-21):

indexers:

* omindex: Make sure that output is flushed after every message, not just after
  some of them.

portability:

* Avoid infinite loop in omindex and scriptindex when reading files under
  Cygwin with automatic end of line translation enabled.  This same bug can
  also manifest on Unix platforms if the file is truncated by another process
  while being read.

Omega 1.0.13 (2009-05-23):

indexers:

* omindex:

  + If the filter program needed for a file format isn't installed, report this
    explicitly when skipping subsequent files with the extension instead of
    misleadingly reporting "Unknown extension".

  + Make -s actually work as a short-form for --stemmer (as documented by
    "omindex --help" and "man omindex").

  + Drop the copyright info from the output of --version as it's perennially
    out of date and we don't report it for any other Xapian programs.

* scriptindex:

  + Add new "valuenumeric" action to add a document value using
    Xapian::sortable_serialise() to allow numeric sorting (ticket#260).

build system:

* configure: Enable more GCC warnings - "-Wstrict-null-sentinel" for 4.0+,
  "-Wlogical-op -Wmissing-declarations" for 4.3+.

Omega 1.0.12 (2009-04-19):

omega:

* $log now retries a partial write, or one interrupted by a system call.

build system:

* configure: Fix iconv parameter type probe not to implicitly cast a string
  literal to char* - this a warning under GCC currently, but the user could
  pass -Werror explicitly in CXXFLAGS, and this could be promoted to an error
  in future GCC versions, and may already be so for some other compilers.

* Overriding CXXFLAGS at make-time (e.g. "make CXXFLAGS=-Os") no longer
  overrides any flags required for building with Xapian.

* We now actually use the compiler warning flags which configure detects.

Omega 1.0.11 (2009-03-15):

documentation:

* cgiparams.html: Note the technique of using a stub database file to allow a
  default of searching over multiple databases.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Add support for indexing Microsoft Office 2007 formats and XPS files
    (bug#290).

  + Fix the extraction of metadata from OpenDocument formats.

  + Fix "-l" which would previously always cause a segmentation fault if used
    ("--depth-limit" wasn't affected).

build system:

* configure: The output of g++ --version changed format (again) with GCC 4.3
  which meant configure got "g++" for the version.  Instead use the (hopefully)
  more robust technique of using g++ -E to pull out __GNUC__ and
  __GNUC_MINOR__.

* configure: Turn on _FORTIFY_SOURCE where available (as we do in xapian-core).

portability:

* Fix to compile when RLIMIT_AS isn't available (as on NetBSD and OpenBSD).
  Instead use RLIMIT_VMEM or RLIMIT_DATA if either is available, else don't try
  to limit the memory the filter process can use.

Omega 1.0.10 (2008-12-23):

build system:

* This release now uses newer versions of the autotools (autoconf 2.62 ->
  2.63; automake 1.10.1 -> 1.10.2).  The newer autoconf fixes a regression
  in autoconf 2.62 (and so Omega 1.0.7) with detecting the endian-ness of some
  platforms.

Omega 1.0.9 (2008-10-31):

documentation:

* docs/overview.html: Document HTML parsing a bit, including robots
  meta and htdig_noindex.

omega:

* omega: Catch std::exception and report what its what() method returns.

* omega: Remove undocumented and non-functional support for numeric sorting
  via CGI parameter SORT=#<slot> (SORT=<slot> works as before).

build system:

* configure: Sync warning flag handling changes from xapian-core to eliminate
  many warnings from GCC 4.3.

Omega 1.0.8 (2008-09-04):

documentation:

* Fix a few typos and improve wording in a few places.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + If the character encoding is specified using <meta http-equiv=...> in an
    HTML document then reparse the document if it isn't the encoding we're
    already using so that any preceding <title> is converted correctly
    (bug#292).

  + Convert text from meta tag parameters to UTF-8 (bug#293).

  + Handle <meta charset="..."> (new in HTML 5).

  + Fix bug in HTML tag parameter parsing which was probably just a small
    performance penalty in real world cases, but could perhaps result in
    parsing bogus extra parameters in carefully contrived situations.

portability:

* Add missing <signal.h>, noted on FreeBSD by Henrik Brix Andersen.

Omega 1.0.7 (2008-07-14):

documentation:

* omegascript.html,scriptindex.html: Fix empty titles.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + When indexing text files, handle UCS-2 and UTF-16 text files with a
    byte-order mark (BOM), and ignore any UTF-8 "byte-order" mark.

  + The built-in conversion code (used when iconv isn't available) now handles
    UCS-2/UTF-16 with and without a BOM, and also the explicit BE and LE forms.

omega:

* Overhaul the $highlight colour combinations since some were rather
  unreadable (Debian bug 484456).

build system:

* configure: Synchronise code for working out warning flags used for builds
  with that used for xapian-core, which in particular handles different
  output formats from "gcc --version".

portability:

* configure: Fix header checks to pre-include <sys/types.h> which Mac OS X
  needs for some other headers to work.

* configure: Fix probing for iconv to work better when iconv isn't found
  (previously this only worked on Mac OS X with fink).

* Fix compilation error on FreeBSD, introduced in 1.0.5.

* In omega, cast size to unsigned before division to avoid a warning about
  signed overflow.

packaging:

* xapian-omega.spec: Remove "www." from xapian.org and oligarchy.co.uk URLs.

Omega 1.0.6 (2008-03-17):

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.html: Improve formatting.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Add support for DjVu files.

  + If we get an error trying to read a directory entry, report it to the user
    rather than ignoring it.

omega:

* New OmegaScript commands $addfilter, $lower, $upper.

portability:

* Check "defined HAVE_SYSMP" rather than just "HAVE_SYSMP".  This doesn't
  change behaviour, but fixes a compile warning on platforms other than Linux
  and IRIX.

Omega 1.0.5 (2007-12-21):

documentation:

* Convert .txt docs to reStructedText which we process to produce HTML.

* Add a note inviting suggestions for additional reliable filter programs.

* overview.html: omindex hasn't generated "W"-prefix terms since 0.9.7, so
  remove the documentation saying it does.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + If a file's extension isn't found in the mime_map and contains uppercase
    ASCII characters, check for the lower cased extension (so .PDF and .Pdf
    behave the same way as .pdf, unless you deliberately add different mappings
    for them).

  + '-f' is documented by --help as a short option for '--follow', but wasn't
    previously actually recognised.

  + Limit filter programs to 7/8 of free physical memory on platforms where we
    know how to determine this statistic (currently at least Linux, FreeBSD,
    IRIX, HP-UX; probably Solaris and a few others too).  This helps to prevent
    runaway filters from causing a denial of service (bug#111).

  + Avoid rereading uncompressed AbiWord documents in order to calculate their
    MD5 checksums.

* scriptindex:

  + Now inserts a ':' between prefix and term, using the same criteria which
    Xapian::QueryParser does.

  + The 'BOOLEAN' action now ignores an empty input rather than adding just the
    prefix as a term.

  + The 'UNIQUE' action now issues a warning for empty input but otherwise
    ignores it.

portability:

* Add explicit includes of C headers needed to build with the latest snapshots
  of GCC 4.3.

Omega 1.0.4 (2007-10-30):

omega:

* If an OmegaScript template specifies the same field name as both a boolean
  and a probabilistic term prefix then previous the boolean setting would
  be ignored (e.g. $setmap{prefix,foo,A}$setmap{boolprefix,foo,H}).  Now this
  generates an error.  If you set prefixes in your templates, you may wish to
  check them over before upgrading.

Omega 1.0.3 (2007-09-28):

general:

* Distribution tarballs are now in the POSIX "ustar" format since it saves
  a few KB and we need to use it for xapian-core anyway.

documentation:

* Expand the output of 'mbox2omega --help' and refer the reader to it from
  docs/scriptindex.txt.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Add support for indexing AbiWord documents and TeX DVI files.

  + Impose a 5 minute CPU time limit on filter programs to prevent problems if
    a filter program goes into an infinite loop on a malformed input.  Partly
    addresses bug#111.

* scriptindex:

  + Fix line number tracking in dump files.

omega:

* Add $muldiv{A,B,C} which calculates int(A*B/C).

* Fix bug in decimal fraction in $size for files >= 1M in size.

templates:

* query:

  + Set HTML charset to utf-8 since that's what databases now are by default.

  + Restyle to use CSS to draw a "score bar" instead of using images.

  + Rework the layout of each hit.

  + Add popup hints on mouse-over for various items.

  + Tidy up some HTML gremlins.

Omega 1.0.2 (2007-07-05):

documentation:

* scriptindex.txt: Fix typo.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + If --url isn't passed, default to "/", but print a warning noting that this
    default has been used (at least for now).

  + Report files that aren't indexed because their extensions aren't
    recognised.

build system:

* Value of XAPIAN_CONFIG supplied to configure is now passed to distcheck,
  to ensure that it works with uninstalled copies of Xapian.

portability:

* Fix test programs to build with a development snapshot of GCC 4.3.

Omega 1.0.1 (2007-06-11):

documentation:

* overview.txt: As of 1.0.0, we no longer use pstotext for PostScript, but
  instead use ps2pdf followed by pdftotext (since this works for Unicode).

* scriptindex.txt: Document that you can delete a document by supplying a new
  document which only contains the unique term.

indexers:

* Fix bug in HTML parser - if the text between two tags consisted entirely of
  whitespace it would just be ignored which could run words together if
  the tags didn't produce implicit whitespace.  This bug dates back to at least
  Omega 0.8.2.

* omindex: Under Linux (and probably some other platforms) struct dirent can
  tell us the type of a directory entry for some filing systems, so make use of
  this to avoid calling stat() (or lstat()) unnecessarily - when indexing
  /usr/share/doc on my Linux box, this saves about 14000 explicit calls to
  stat() (leaving about 7000).

omega:

* Fix handling of query parsing errors (broken by changes in 1.0.0).

packaging:

* The required automake version has been lowered to 1.8.3, so RPMs can now be
  built on RHEL 4 and SLES 9.

Omega 1.0.0 (2007-05-17):

general:

* Omega and the indexers now work in UTF-8.  If iconv() is available, omindex
  will use it to convert documents from other formats, otherwise it has
  built-in support for UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1; omindex knows how to run the
  various external filter programs to generate UTF-8 output; scriptindex
  assumes input is already in UTF-8.

* Change the project name (used to name tarballs, and default installation
  paths) to "xapian-omega" since that's what the RPMs and Debian packages
  already use (there's a Rogue-like game called Omega).

documentation:

* docs/overview.txt: Document what each of the OmegaScript templates does.

* docs/quickstart.txt: Assorted minor improvements.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Document new 'Z' prefix, and that the 'R' and 'W'
  prefixes are no longer used by Xapian.

* docs/cgiparams.txt: FMT isn't limited to just `a-z' - the actual restriction
  is that it may not contain `..'.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Explicitly note that index=nopos is deprecated
  (scriptindex already emits a warning).

* NEWS: Add note that Omega < 0.8.0 NEWS entries are in the xapian-core NEWS
  file.

* TODO: Updated.

indexers:

* Updated to use the new Xapian::TermGenerator class.  This means that the
  indexing strategy has changed.

* "--help" now reports the default stemming language (i.e. "english").

* Implement new sample generating function which normalises all runs of
  whitespace to a single space, and fixes invalid UTF-8 in the sample.

* omindex:

  + We now index PostScript by converting to PDF with ps2pdf and then indexing
    that.  This allows us to index PostScript files containing Unicode
    characters outside of ISO-8859-1, and also means we now get metadata from
    PostScript files.  The downside is it is quite a bit slower.

  + Add support for indexing MS Works documents using wps2text (part of
    libwps).

  + Don't index empty files.

* scriptindex:

  + Fix optimisation of "load truncate=N" to actually work!

  + The "truncate" action knows not to chop off a multibyte UTF-8 character.

  + Update short option list for scriptindex to match documented usage (-h, -V
    and -s were not working).

  + Remove -q and -u options - they no longer do anything and are only accepted
    for compatibility with really old versions (0.6.1 and earlier for -q; 0.7.5
    and earlier for -u).

omega:

* Add an alternative implementation of date range filtering which uses a
  MatchDecider.  This allows everything that the existing implementation does,
  plus you can support sorting on a choice of dates (e.g. first published or
  last updated), and filtering works to a resolution of a minute rather than a
  day.  Set CGI parameter DATEVALUE to enable this, and to specify the value to
  use.  Since omindex now adds the last modified date as value 0, this will
  work with omindex.

* Enhance $substr{} to accept a negative length (meaning to count back from the
  end of the string).

* New CGI parameters to allow finer control of sorting and ranking - SORTAFTER
  and DOCIDORDER.

* The sorting options are now encoded in $filters so Omega can automatically
  reset to page 1 if they are changed.

* Add new OmegaScript $weight command which returns the raw document weight -
  mostly useful for debugging purposes.

* $topterms{} now generates unstemmed terms.

* $prettyterm{TERM} has been updated to fit with changes to the term generation
  strategy.

* Add 'you' and 'your' as stopwords.

* $filesize{SIZE} enhanced to return a decimal point for K, M, and G (e.g.
  "2.1K" and "4.0M" rather than "2K" and "4M"); $filesize{0} is now "0 bytes";
  $filesize{1} is now "1 byte"; $filesize{SIZE} where SIZE is negative is now
  "".

* Remove $freqs as it has been deprecated for ages.

* Remove support for xB, xDATE1, xDATE2, xDAYSMINUS, and xDEFAULTOP which were
  deprecated in favour of xFILTER in 0.7.5 (over 3 years ago).

* Remove deprecated aliases for CGI parameters (deprecated in 0.6.3 or 0.6.5,
  more than 3.5 years ago): RAW_SEARCH (now RAWSEARCH), DATE1 (now START),
  DATE2 (now END), DAYSMINUS (now SPAN but with slightly different semantics),
  and MIN_HITS (now MINHITS).

* Remove "bias_weight" and "bias_halflife" CGI parameters since they rely on
  Enquire::set_bias() which has been removed.

templates:

* The 'query' template no longer uses $topterms by default.

* New 'topterms' template provides a query template with $topterms support.

* Template fragments which aren't intended for direct use have been moved to
  an "inc" subdirectory.

testsuite:

* md5test: Add tests for MD5 code.

build system:

* `./configure --enable-quiet' already allows you to specify at configure time
  to pass `--quiet' to libtool.  Now you can override this at make-time by
  using `make QUIET=' (to turn off `--quiet') or `make QUIET=y' (to turn on
  `--quiet').

* configure: Disable probes for f77, gcj, and rc completely by preventing
  the probe code from even appearing in configure - this reduces the size of
  configure by 29% and should speed it up significantly.

portability:

* Fixed to build with GCC 4.3 snapshot.

* We now make use of the safe*.h portability headers from xapian-core.

* Ensure that the result of snprintf is zero terminated since MSVC's snprintf
  is broken (by design it seems).

* configure: xapian-config --cxxflags now includes -ptused for SGI's C++
  compiler, so we don't need to probe for it here.

* configure: Perform a link test for posix_fadvise to fix misdetection on
  HP-UX.

Omega 0.9.10 (2007-03-04):

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.txt: Rewrite introductory paragraph.  Note that
  whitespace is significant, and add explicit warning to $setmap.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Expand section on boolean prefixes, showing
  how to generate them using scriptindex, and how to allow them to be
  selected in an HTML form.

indexers:

* omindex: Generate correct MD5 checksums on big-endian platforms.

omega:

* Fix $substr{} with negative start to actually work.

* Fix $substr{} to never cause a C++ exception.

packaging:

* omega.spec.in: Remove "." from the end of the Summary.

Omega 0.9.9 (2006-11-09):

documentation:

* Ship our custom INSTALL file rather than the generic one from autoconf which
  we've accidentally been shipping instead since 0.9.5.

indexers:

* scriptindex: The "date" action no longer modifies the value it operates on
  (it was never meant to!)

omega:

* Report an error if $setmap is called with an even number of parameters.
  An incorrect example in the documentation used to suggest this, so it's
  particularly useful to catch this case.

packaging:

* RPMs: Prevent binaries getting an rpath for /usr/lib64 on FC6.

Omega 0.9.8 (2006-11-02):

omega:

* $substr where the start is negative and longer than the string (e.g.
  $substr{abcd,-5,1}) wasn't working as intended.

build system:

* configure: Tell AC_CHECK_HEADERS to suppress its backward compatibility mode,
  so it only checks headers with the compiler.  This speeds up configure a
  little, and is what we do elsewhere.

* configure: Warning flags for GCC weren't actually getting used.  Fix this to
  work and use the same warning flags for GCC and Intel C++ as xapian-core does.
  Fix all the warnings this uncovered!

* omega,omindex,scriptindex: Remove some old unused code.

portability:

* Ensure that we always pass an unsigned char value to isupper(), toupper(),
  etc as they are undefined on other values (glibc makes them work for signed
  char values too, but this is an extension).

* configure: Pass magic options to SGI's C++ compiler to allow linking of
  templates to work.

* configure: IRIX doesn't allow stdint.h to be included from C++ so we need
  a smarter configure test than AC_CHECK_HEADERS.

* Fix warnings from SGI's C++ compiler.

Omega 0.9.7 (2006-10-10):

documentation:

* omegascript.txt: Note that (by design) an omegascript template can't
  contain an infinite loop.

* termprefixes.txt: "$setmap{title,S}" should be "$setmap{prefix,title,S}".

* Use the default paths to the database directories and the omega CGI binary in
  examples.

* README: Update reference to "CVS" to say "SVN".

indexers:

* Don't get confused by "a<b" in Javascript in a <script> tag.  Fixes bug#91.

* Support htdig's "ignore this bit" comments.

* Don't generate terms with more than 3 trailing symbols ('-', '+', or '#').

* omindex:

  + Add the file last modified time as value #0.

  + Generate an MD5 checksum of each file indexed and store it in value #1
    to allow duplicates to be collapsed.

  + Store the file's last modified time in the document data as "modtime" so it
    shows up in search results (and tweak the query template so the display of
    this information looks nicer).  Don't add "modtime" field if the timestamp
    is (time_t)-1.

  + Run pdfinfo once and pull out the fields we want using string operations,
    instead of running it twice filtered through sed.

  + Parse the XML from OpenDocument and OpenOffice using new subclasses of
    HtmlParser.  Only extract meta.xml once.

  + Add "size" field to document data.

  + Run xls2csv on MS Excel files, run catppt on MS Powerpoint files, and also
    index MS Word templates (.dot) the same way as .doc files.

  + Don't generate 'W' terms since omega doesn't use them.

  + If a filter program isn't installed, then don't try it again for the same
    extension (not perfect but an improvement - previously we indexed an empty
    document!)

  + If popen() fails, treat it as a read error.

* scriptindex:

  + Add new "load" action to allow the contents of an external file to be
    loaded and parsed.

  + Fix check for whether a record has content in the case where the same field
    is processed more than once.

omega:

* Add $pack and $unpack OmegaScript commands to allow big endian binary values
  to be encoded and decoded (for use with omindex's lastmod in value #1).

* omega.conf: Fix code which reads omega.conf to be line based as documented
  rather than the wacky whitespace based scheme that was actually implemented.
  Also we now allow "#" comments and blank lines in omega.conf.

* Fix $highlight{} to work with capitalised words (it used to work but
  regressed in 0.8.2).

* Use '\t' to separate terms in xP since filter terms might contain '.'.  Fixes
  bug#87.

testsuite:

* Add htmlparsetest which tests the MyHtmlParser class.

build system:

* Makefile.am: Make use of the dist_ prefix to avoid having to list files in
  EXTRA_DIST as well as in *_SCRIPTS, *_DATA, and man_MANS.

* Makefile.am: Prefer $(sysconfdir) to @sysconfdir@ since the former can be
  overridden on the "make" command line.

portability:

* xapian-config will now switch Sun's C++ compiler into ANSI C++ compliant
  mode, so remove all the special case bits of code added for just this one
  compiler.

* omindex: Fix escaping of filenames to cast characters to "unsigned char" so
  that isalnum() works correctly everywhere.  Not a security hole as dangerous
  characters were still being escaped.

* Call pclose() not fclose() on a FILE* obtained from popen().  This bug could
  cause us to run out of file descriptors on some platforms.

* configure: Check for strftime.

packaging:

* omega.spec.in: Include documentation in the RPM package.

Omega 0.9.6 (2006-05-15):

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.txt: Clarified description of $now.

indexers:

* scriptindex: Fix "index" and "indexnopos" without a prefix to set the weight
  correctly (bug introduced in 0.9.5).

omega:

* Added new OmegaScript commands $filterterms and $substr.

portability:

* configure: Update snprintf detection to match xapian-core.

* Fix MSVC warnings.

packaging:

* omega.spec.in: Create and package /var/lib/omega/cdb and /var/log/omega.

Omega 0.9.5 (2006-04-08):

documentation:

* README: Add pointer to documentation.

* Added man pages for omindex and scriptindex, generated using help2man.

indexers:

* scriptindex:

  + If we fail to open the index script, die with an error (previously we
    acted as if an empty file was specified).

  + Warn about a useless "weight" action, even if it's followed by another
    non-useless action (e.g. "field") - previously we only warned if it
    was last or followed only by other useless actions.

  + Warn if "unique=<prefix>" is used without a corresponding
    "boolean=<prefix>" on the same line.

  + Warn that "index=nopos" is deprecated and should be replaced by
    "indexnopos".

  + Add explanatory text "(note that actions are executed from left to right)"
    when reporting useless actions.

  + Added new "hash" command to allow hashed terms to be generated from long
    URLs like omindex does.

* htdig2omega.script,mbox2omega.script: Make use of the new scriptindex "hash"
  command.

* dbi2omega: Check DBIDRIVER environmental variable to allow a driver other
  than mysql to be specified without modifying the script.

omega:

* Fix $opt[fieldnames] handling.  Previously it would try to kick in if you
  didn't set fieldnames but set any alphabetically later option!  The symptom
  was that $field{} would stop working (bug#72).

portability:

* omindex,omega: Tweaks for MSVC compilation.

Omega 0.9.4 (2006-02-21):

documentation:

* COPYING: Updated FSF address.

Omega 0.9.3 (2006-02-16):

documentation:

* overview.txt: The U prefix (URL term) was grouped with the date searching
  prefixes, but it makes more sense to group it with the prefixes relating to
  parts of the URL (H for hostname, P for path, etc).

* overview.txt: Add pointer to documentation of the supported query syntax.

* omegascript.txt: Improve descriptions of $cgi, $collapsed, $value, $version.

* termprefixes.txt: Fix typo.

indexers:

* omindex: add --preserve-nonduplicates / -p option to not delete any documents
  that aren't updated, in replace duplicates mode (so that multiple runs of
  omindex on different subsites don't stomp on each other).

* omindex,scriptindex: Add "--stemmer" option to omindex and scriptindex
  to allow the stemming language to be set.  Fixes bug#11.

* omindex,scriptindex: More consistent --help and --version output.

* omindex: Add support for OpenDocument format mimetypes and extensions out of
  the box.  Previously you could index them but had to pass a "-m" option for
  each OpenDocument filename extension you wanted to handle.

* scriptindex: The "-q" option no longer actually controls anything.  Just
  ignore it for backwards compatibility (and don't document it in --help).

omega:

* If executing an OmegaScript command causes a Xapian exception to be thrown,
  catch it and copy the error message into error_msg (which is read by the
  $error command).  This allows such errors to reported in a nicer way.

* Added "SORTREVERSE" CGI parameter which allows the sort order to be reversed
  when sorting on a value.  Removed "SORTBANDS" CGI parameter since it no
  longer does anything.

* Added $find{LIST,STRING} to return the subscript of the first occurrence of
  string STRING in list LIST.

* Added $lookup{CDBFILE,KEY} OmegaScript command to perform a lookup in a CDB
  file.

* Added new feature which allows you to avoid storing fieldnames in every
  document.  Instead you just store the field values, one per line, and add
  something like "$set{fieldnames,$split{caption sample url}}" to the
  OmegaScript template to specify the fieldnames to use.  This can save a lot
  of disk space for a large database.

* Add new "$split{}" OmegaScript command which splits a string to give an
  OmegaScript list.

* Fix $url{} to escape "+" to "%2b".  Also fix encoding of top-bit-set
  characters on platforms where char is signed by default.

* Speed up $highlight{} - only compare terms which are the same length.

* Reduce memory usage if a lot of documents are marked as relevant.

templates:

* query: Make the page title shorter so there's more chance it will fit on icon
  bars, etc.

* opensearch: Add missing escaping.

* godmode: If a non-existent docid is specified, report the error and prompt
  the user to enter another docid.  Fixes bug#60.

portability:

* omega: Fix printf type mismatch on 64 bit platforms.

* omega: Cast time_t to unsigned long to avoid problems on 64bit platforms.

* Use snprintf where available.

* Write top-bit set characters using \xXX notation to avoid warnings from
  Intel's C++ compiler.

Omega 0.9.2 (2005-07-15):

* omega: Changed $highlight so if OPEN and CLOSE aren't specified, they default
  to highlighting each word from the query with a different background colour
  like gmane does (previous default was to use '<strong>' and '</strong>').

* omega: Call QueryParser::set_database() as this is now used to decide what to
  do for terms like "C#".

* omega: Added the ability to set boolean prefixes for the QueryParser by
  setting a "boolprefix" map in the omegascript template.

* omega: Added $length{} and $stoplist{} commands to OmegaScript.

* scriptindex: Fix infinite loop if there's no newline at the end of a dumpfile.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Explain how to use termprefixes with scriptindex and
  omega, since that's what most people will want to know.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Use standard "S" prefix for title in example for
  $setmap, rather than "XT".

Omega 0.9.1 (2005-06-06):

* Releases are now created using libtool 1.5.18 and automake 1.9.5.

* Updated RPM packaging.

Omega 0.9.0 (2005-05-13):

* Updated for 0.9.0 API changes.

* omindex/scriptindex: Generate terms like "c#".

* Added mbox2omega script which allows a mail folder to be indexed using
  scriptindex.  Mostly it's an example as there's no mechanism included to show
  the full original message.

omega:

* The configuration file is now looked for differently - you can now set
  the environmental variable OMEGA_CONFIG_FILE.  See docs/overview.txt for
  details.

* $highlight can now highlight terms like "C#".

* Add new template 'opensearch' to implement basic opensearch feeds of search
  results.

omindex:

* URL hashing previously depended on sizeof(long) so databases weren't totally
  portable between platforms.  This is now fixed, but to do so we've had to
  break compatibility with databases built on platforms with 64 bit longs
  with URLs > 228 bytes.

* Removed useless "DUPE_duplicate" option.

* Added support for indexing Perl "pod" documentation using pod2text.

* Replaced -l/--no-recurse with -l/--depth-limit which takes an argument
  allowing recursion to be restriction to any depth, not just 0 or infinity!

* Extend -M/--mime-type to allow an existing mapping to be removed by omitting
  the type.

* Fixed code so that we get lstat() prototype on Linux systems where we have
  posix_fadvise().

scriptindex:

* Improved handling of extra blank lines in dump file.

* Strip multiple \r characters from end of line.

* Complain if a dump file doesn't appear to have been = escaped correctly.

* Flush database after each input file to ensure all changes from a file
  make it in.

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.txt: Clarify $field description slightly.

* docs/cgiparams.txt,docs/omegascript.txt: Fixed 3 references to OmXxxx classes.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Added a single document covering all aspects of term
  prefixes.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Moved $collapsed into correct place alphabetically!

* docs/cgiparams.txt,docs/overview.txt: Improved description of how B filters
  are handled when building the query.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Note that actions are applied in the specified order.

Omega 0.8.5 (2004-12-23):

* README,INSTALL: Proper installation instructions.

* omega: If an exception is thrown, make sure that the HTTP headers
  get written so that we don't cause "500 Internal Server Error".
  This problem was introduced by the change to allow a user specified
  Content-Type in 0.8.0.  Partly addresses bug#60.

* scriptindex: Fixed "Unknown Exception" when trying to "unhtml" text which
  contains "</body>" (bug#61).  This bug was introduced in 0.8.4.

* omindex/scriptindex: <h1> - <h6> and </h1> - </h6> now leave a space in the
  dumped HTML.  This bug was introduced in 0.8.4 - before that any tag left
  a space in the dumped HTML.

* omindex: Only try to delete removed documents in "replace duplicates" mode
  (which is the default).

* omindex: Change behaviour of crawler such that it doesn't follow symbolic
  links any more.  The new "--follow" command line option turns following of
  symlinks back on.

* dbi2omega: Add a comment to the start of the file detailing what
  dbi2omega does.

Omega 0.8.4 (2004-12-08):

* omindex,scriptindex: Improved HTML to text conversion - now we strip
  leading and trailing whitespace and convert all other consecutive groups of
  whitespace to a single space.  Also the parser now knows that some tags
  should be regarded as word breaks and some shouldn't (previously all tags
  were treated as word breaks).

* omindex: Removed bogus extra line from code which was meant to
  truncate samples, titles, etc at a word boundary, but has never actually
  worked!

* omindex: Added hooks for indexing the following formats: OpenOffice (requires
  unzip), MS Word (requires antiword), Wordperfect (requires wpd2text), RTF
  (requires unrtf).

* omindex: If a filename to be passed to a filter program has a leading "-",
  protect it from possible interpretation as an option by prepending "./".

* omega: When there's only a boolean query we promote it to be the query.
  Tweaked so we use boolean weights in this case.

* omega: Use Query::empty() instead of the now deprecated Query::is_empty().

* omega,omindex,scriptindex: Use the new Database/WritableDatabase
  constructors.

* templates/godmode: Finished off godmode template.

* Compile everything as C++.

* Check snprintf actually works - some older versions don't implement C90
  snprintf semantics.

* XAPIAN_FLAGS already links with xapianqueryparser so remove
  -lxapianqueryparser from omega_LDADD as it was causing link errors on cygwin.

Omega 0.8.3 (2004-09-20):

* scriptindex: --version now actually reports the version.  --help now exits
  with status 0 rather than status 1.

* RPM packaging: Updated.  The most notable change is that the RPM is now
  called xapian-omega because there's already an omega RPM (in Fedora Core at
  least) which is a game.  Also htdig2omega and htdig2omega.script are now
  included in the RPM.

* Install htdig2omega.script in ${prefix}/share/omega/ rather than
  ${prefix}/share/.

Omega 0.8.2 (2004-09-13):

* omega: $highlight now handles accented characters (bug#9).

* omega: Use new checkatleast parameter to Enquire::get_mset to implement
  MINHITS.

* omindex: When running with "replace duplicates" mode (the default), detect
  documents removed since the last indexing run and delete them from the
  database (bug #34).

* omindex: Use the new WritableDatabase::replace_document(term, doc) method.

* scriptindex: Report index script file name and line number when
  reporting errors in it.  Added warning for redundant actions,
  such as "truncate" as the last action in a rule.

* templates/query: Always report if the database is not found - previously we
  only did so if there was a query.

* templates/query: Fixed missing </center> tag which happened in certain cases.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Added note about that $add{$hit,1} gives
  the "hit number".

* Now includes htdig2omega and htdig2omega.script which allow you to crawl
  remote websites with ht://dig, then build a searchable index of them with
  Xapian and Omega.

* Link with -lxapianqueryparser, not -lomqueryparser.

Omega 0.8.1 (2004-06-30):

* omindex: Renamed hash() to hash_string() to avoid colliding with something
  on IRIX.

* omega: Changed MORELIKE to pick up to 40 terms, rather than up to 6 (feedback
  on the mailing list suggests this gives much better results).

* scriptindex: Added explicit catch for std::bad_alloc.

Omega 0.8.0 (2004-04-19):

* scriptindex: Change default to *not* overwriting the database (use
  --overwrite if you really want to do this); -u is now accepted but ignored.

* scriptindex: Use getopt for option parsing.

* omindex: Added --overwrite option which forces an existing database to be
  deleted before indexing begins.

* templates/xml: Correct spelling of `relavence' to `relevance'.  NB: if you're
  parsing the XML output, you'll need to fix this spelling in your parser!

* templates/xml: Now set HTTP header: "Content-Type: application/html".

* templates/xml: Remove unused OmegaScript code:
  `$set{topterms,$or{$ne{$msize,0},$query}}'.

* indextext.cc,omindex.cc,scriptindex.cc: Updated to use add_term() instead of
  add_term_nopos().

* omega: Added $httpheader Omegascript to allow arbitrary HTTP headers and
  alternative Content-Type headers to be specified.

* omega: If the probabilistic query was bad, don't try to run the match.

* omega: Don't crash if there's a date filter but no probabilistic query.

* omindex/scriptindex: Raw terms with a multicharacter prefix are now indexed
  with a : inserted (e.g. as XFOO:Rterm).  This matches what the query parser
  does.

* omindex/scriptindex: Don't create R terms for terms which start with a digit.

* omindex: Use O_STREAMING and/or posix_fadvise() when reading files to be
  indexed (if available).  This helps to keep the Xapian database in cache,
  and should greatly improve indexing throughput.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Make more explicit that boolean produces a *single*
  boolean term.

* docs/cgiparams.txt: Note that START and END should be in the format YYYYMMDD.
