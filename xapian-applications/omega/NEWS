Omega 1.0.3 (2007-09-2?):

general:

* Distribution tarballs are now in the POSIX "ustar" format since it saves
  a few KB and we need to use it for xapian-core anyway.

documentation:

indexers:

* omindex:

  + Add support for indexing AbiWord documents and TeX DVI files.

  + Impose a 5 minute CPU time limit on filter programs to prevent problems if
    a filter program goes into an infinite loop on a malformed input.  Partly
    addresses bug#111.

* scriptindex:

  + Fix line number tracking in dump files.

omega:

* Add $muldiv{A,B,C} which calculates int(A*B/C).

* Fix bug in decimal fraction in $size for files >= 1M in size.

templates:

* query:

  + Set HTML charset to utf-8 since that's what databases now are by default.

  + Restyle to use CSS to draw a "score bar" instead of using images.

  + Rework the layout of each hit.

  + Add popup hints on mouse-over for various items.

  + Tidy up some HTML gremlins.

testsuite:

build system:

portability:

Omega 1.0.2 (2007-07-05):

documentation:

* scriptindex.txt: Fix typo.

indexers:

* omindex:

  + If --url isn't passed, default to "/", but print a warning noting that this
    default has been used (at least for now).

  + Report files that aren't indexed because their extensions aren't
    recognised.

build system:

* Value of XAPIAN_CONFIG supplied to configure is now passed to distcheck,
  to ensure that it works with uninstalled copies of Xapian.

portability:

* Fix test programs to build with a development snapshot of GCC 4.3.

Omega 1.0.1 (2007-06-11):

documentation:

* overview.txt: As of 1.0.0, we no longer use pstotext for PostScript, but
  instead use ps2pdf followed by pdftotext (since this works for Unicode).

* scriptindex.txt: Document that you can delete a document by supplying a new
  document which only contains the unique term.

indexers:

* Fix bug in HTML parser - if the text between two tags consisted entirely of
  whitespace it would just be ignored which could run words together if
  the tags didn't produce implicit whitespace.  This bug dates back to at least
  Omega 0.8.2.

* omindex: Under Linux (and probably some other platforms) struct dirent can
  tell us the type of a directory entry for some filing systems, so make use of
  this to avoid calling stat() (or lstat()) unnecessarily - when indexing
  /usr/share/doc on my Linux box, this saves about 14000 explicit calls to
  stat() (leaving about 7000).

omega:

* Fix handling of query parsing errors (broken by changes in 1.0.0).

packaging:

* The required automake version has been lowered to 1.8.3, so RPMs can now be
  built on RHEL 4 and SLES 9.

Omega 1.0.0 (2007-05-17):

general:

* Omega and the indexers now work in UTF-8.  If iconv() is available, omindex
  will use it to convert documents from other formats, otherwise it has
  built-in support for UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1; omindex knows how to run the
  various external filter programs to generate UTF-8 output; scriptindex
  assumes input is already in UTF-8.

* Change the project name (used to name tarballs, and default installation
  paths) to "xapian-omega" since that's what the RPMs and Debian packages
  already use (there's a Rogue-like game called Omega).

documentation:

* docs/overview.txt: Document what each of the OmegaScript templates does.

* docs/quickstart.txt: Assorted minor improvements.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Document new 'Z' prefix, and that the 'R' and 'W'
  prefixes are no longer used by Xapian.

* docs/cgiparams.txt: FMT isn't limited to just `a-z' - the actual restriction
  is that it may not contain `..'.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Explicitly note that index=nopos is deprecated
  (scriptindex already emits a warning).

* NEWS: Add note that Omega < 0.8.0 NEWS entries are in the xapian-core NEWS
  file.

* TODO: Updated.

indexers:

* Updated to use the new Xapian::TermGenerator class.  This means that the
  indexing strategy has changed.

* "--help" now reports the default stemming language (i.e. "english").

* Implement new sample generating function which normalises all runs of
  whitespace to a single space, and fixes invalid UTF-8 in the sample.

* omindex:

  + We now index PostScript by converting to PDF with ps2pdf and then indexing
    that.  This allows us to index PostScript files containing Unicode
    characters outside of ISO-8859-1, and also means we now get metadata from
    PostScript files.  The downside is it is quite a bit slower.

  + Add support for indexing MS Works documents using wps2text (part of
    libwps).

  + Don't index empty files.

* scriptindex:

  + Fix optimisation of "load truncate=N" to actually work!

  + The "truncate" action knows not to chop off a multibyte UTF-8 character.

  + Update short option list for scriptindex to match documented usage (-h, -V
    and -s were not working).

  + Remove -q and -u options - they no longer do anything and are only accepted
    for compatibility with really old versions (0.6.1 and earlier for -q; 0.7.5
    and earlier for -u).

omega:

* Add an alternative implementation of date range filtering which uses a
  MatchDecider.  This allows everything that the existing implementation does,
  plus you can support sorting on a choice of dates (e.g. first published or
  last updated), and filtering works to a resolution of a minute rather than a
  day.  Set CGI parameter DATEVALUE to enable this, and to specify the value to
  use.  Since omindex now adds the last modified date as value 0, this will
  work with omindex.

* Enhance $substr{} to accept a negative length (meaning to count back from the
  end of the string).

* New CGI parameters to allow finer control of sorting and ranking - SORTAFTER
  and DOCIDORDER.

* The sorting options are now encoded in $filters so Omega can automatically
  reset to page 1 if they are changed.

* Add new OmegaScript $weight command which returns the raw document weight -
  mostly useful for debugging purposes.

* $topterms{} now generates unstemmed terms.

* $prettyterm{TERM} has been updated to fit with changes to the term generation
  strategy.

* Add 'you' and 'your' as stopwords.

* $filesize{SIZE} enhanced to return a decimal point for K, M, and G (e.g.
  "2.1K" and "4.0M" rather than "2K" and "4M"); $filesize{0} is now "0 bytes";
  $filesize{1} is now "1 byte"; $filesize{SIZE} where SIZE is negative is now
  "".

* Remove $freqs as it has been deprecated for ages.

* Remove support for xB, xDATE1, xDATE2, xDAYSMINUS, and xDEFAULTOP which were
  deprecated in favour of xFILTER in 0.7.5 (over 3 years ago).

* Remove deprecated aliases for CGI parameters (deprecated in 0.6.3 or 0.6.5,
  more than 3.5 years ago): RAW_SEARCH (now RAWSEARCH), DATE1 (now START),
  DATE2 (now END), DAYSMINUS (now SPAN but with slightly different semantics),
  and MIN_HITS (now MINHITS).

* Remove "bias_weight" and "bias_halflife" CGI parameters since they rely on
  Enquire::set_bias() which has been removed.

templates:

* The 'query' template no longer uses $topterms by default.

* New 'topterms' template provides a query template with $topterms support.

* Template fragments which aren't intended for direct use have been moved to
  an "inc" subdirectory.

testsuite:

* md5test: Add tests for MD5 code.

build system:

* `./configure --enable-quiet' already allows you to specify at configure time
  to pass `--quiet' to libtool.  Now you can override this at make-time by
  using `make QUIET=' (to turn off `--quiet') or `make QUIET=y' (to turn on
  `--quiet').

* configure: Disable probes for f77, gcj, and rc completely by preventing
  the probe code from even appearing in configure - this reduces the size of
  configure by 29% and should speed it up significantly.

portability:

* Fixed to build with GCC 4.3 snapshot.

* We now make use of the safe*.h portability headers from xapian-core.

* Ensure that the result of snprintf is zero terminated since MSVC's snprintf
  is broken (by design it seems).

* configure: xapian-config --cxxflags now includes -ptused for SGI's C++
  compiler, so we don't need to probe for it here.

* configure: Perform a link test for posix_fadvise to fix misdetection on
  HP-UX.

Omega 0.9.10 (2007-03-04):

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.txt: Rewrite introductory paragraph.  Note that
  whitespace is significant, and add explicit warning to $setmap.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Expand section on boolean prefixes, showing
  how to generate them using scriptindex, and how to allow them to be
  selected in an HTML form.

indexers:

* omindex: Generate correct MD5 checksums on big-endian platforms.

omega:

* Fix $substr{} with negative start to actually work.

* Fix $substr{} to never cause a C++ exception.

packaging:

* omega.spec.in: Remove "." from the end of the Summary.

Omega 0.9.9 (2006-11-09):

documentation:

* Ship our custom INSTALL file rather than the generic one from autoconf which
  we've accidentally been shipping instead since 0.9.5.

indexers:

* scriptindex: The "date" action no longer modifies the value it operates on
  (it was never meant to!)

omega:

* Report an error if $setmap is called with an even number of parameters.
  An incorrect example in the documentation used to suggest this, so it's
  particularly useful to catch this case.

packaging:

* RPMs: Prevent binaries getting an rpath for /usr/lib64 on FC6.

Omega 0.9.8 (2006-11-02):

omega:

* $substr where the start is negative and longer than the string (e.g.
  $substr{abcd,-5,1}) wasn't working as intended.

build system:

* configure: Tell AC_CHECK_HEADERS to suppress its backward compatibility mode,
  so it only checks headers with the compiler.  This speeds up configure a
  little, and is what we do elsewhere.

* configure: Warning flags for GCC weren't actually getting used.  Fix this to
  work and use the same warning flags for GCC and Intel C++ as xapian-core does.
  Fix all the warnings this uncovered!

* omega,omindex,scriptindex: Remove some old unused code.

portability:

* Ensure that we always pass an unsigned char value to isupper(), toupper(),
  etc as they are undefined on other values (glibc makes them work for signed
  char values too, but this is an extension).

* configure: Pass magic options to SGI's C++ compiler to allow linking of
  templates to work.

* configure: IRIX doesn't allow stdint.h to be included from C++ so we need
  a smarter configure test than AC_CHECK_HEADERS.

* Fix warnings from SGI's C++ compiler.

Omega 0.9.7 (2006-10-10):

documentation:

* omegascript.txt: Note that (by design) an omegascript template can't
  contain an infinite loop.

* termprefixes.txt: "$setmap{title,S}" should be "$setmap{prefix,title,S}".

* Use the default paths to the database directories and the omega CGI binary in
  examples.

* README: Update reference to "CVS" to say "SVN".

indexers:

* Don't get confused by "a<b" in Javascript in a <script> tag.  Fixes bug#91.

* Support htdig's "ignore this bit" comments.

* Don't generate terms with more than 3 trailing symbols ('-', '+', or '#').

* omindex:

  + Add the file last modified time as value #0.

  + Generate an MD5 checksum of each file indexed and store it in value #1
    to allow duplicates to be collapsed.

  + Store the file's last modified time in the document data as "modtime" so it
    shows up in search results (and tweak the query template so the display of
    this information looks nicer).  Don't add "modtime" field if the timestamp
    is (time_t)-1.

  + Run pdfinfo once and pull out the fields we want using string operations,
    instead of running it twice filtered through sed.

  + Parse the XML from OpenDocument and OpenOffice using new subclasses of
    HtmlParser.  Only extract meta.xml once.

  + Add "size" field to document data.

  + Run xls2csv on MS Excel files, run catppt on MS Powerpoint files, and also
    index MS Word templates (.dot) the same way as .doc files.

  + Don't generate 'W' terms since omega doesn't use them.

  + If a filter program isn't installed, then don't try it again for the same
    extension (not perfect but an improvement - previously we indexed an empty
    document!)

  + If popen() fails, treat it as a read error.

* scriptindex:

  + Add new "load" action to allow the contents of an external file to be
    loaded and parsed.

  + Fix check for whether a record has content in the case where the same field
    is processed more than once.

omega:

* Add $pack and $unpack OmegaScript commands to allow big endian binary values
  to be encoded and decoded (for use with omindex's lastmod in value #1).

* omega.conf: Fix code which reads omega.conf to be line based as documented
  rather than the wacky whitespace based scheme that was actually implemented.
  Also we now allow "#" comments and blank lines in omega.conf.

* Fix $highlight{} to work with capitalised words (it used to work but
  regressed in 0.8.2).

* Use '\t' to separate terms in xP since filter terms might contain '.'.  Fixes
  bug#87.

testsuite:

* Add htmlparsetest which tests the MyHtmlParser class.

build system:

* Makefile.am: Make use of the dist_ prefix to avoid having to list files in
  EXTRA_DIST as well as in *_SCRIPTS, *_DATA, and man_MANS.

* Makefile.am: Prefer $(sysconfdir) to @sysconfdir@ since the former can be
  overridden on the "make" command line.

portability:

* xapian-config will now switch Sun's C++ compiler into ANSI C++ compliant
  mode, so remove all the special case bits of code added for just this one
  compiler.

* omindex: Fix escaping of filenames to cast characters to "unsigned char" so
  that isalnum() works correctly everywhere.  Not a security hole as dangerous
  characters were still being escaped.

* Call pclose() not fclose() on a FILE* obtained from popen().  This bug could
  cause us to run out of file descriptors on some platforms.

* configure: Check for strftime.

packaging:

* omega.spec.in: Include documentation in the RPM package.

Omega 0.9.6 (2006-05-15):

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.txt: Clarified description of $now.

indexers:

* scriptindex: Fix "index" and "indexnopos" without a prefix to set the weight
  correctly (bug introduced in 0.9.5).

omega:

* Added new OmegaScript commands $filterterms and $substr.

portability:

* configure: Update snprintf detection to match xapian-core.

* Fix MSVC warnings.

packaging:

* omega.spec.in: Create and package /var/lib/omega/cdb and /var/log/omega.

Omega 0.9.5 (2006-04-08):

documentation:

* README: Add pointer to documentation.

* Added man pages for omindex and scriptindex, generated using help2man.

indexers:

* scriptindex:

  + If we fail to open the index script, die with an error (previously we
    acted as if an empty file was specified).

  + Warn about a useless "weight" action, even if it's followed by another
    non-useless action (e.g. "field") - previously we only warned if it
    was last or followed only by other useless actions.

  + Warn if "unique=<prefix>" is used without a corresponding
    "boolean=<prefix>" on the same line.

  + Warn that "index=nopos" is deprecated and should be replaced by
    "indexnopos".

  + Add explanatory text "(note that actions are executed from left to right)"
    when reporting useless actions.

  + Added new "hash" command to allow hashed terms to be generated from long
    URLs like omindex does.

* htdig2omega.script,mbox2omega.script: Make use of the new scriptindex "hash"
  command.

* dbi2omega: Check DBIDRIVER environmental variable to allow a driver other
  than mysql to be specified without modifying the script.

omega:

* Fix $opt[fieldnames] handling.  Previously it would try to kick in if you
  didn't set fieldnames but set any alphabetically later option!  The symptom
  was that $field{} would stop working (bug#72).

portability:

* omindex,omega: Tweaks for MSVC compilation.

Omega 0.9.4 (2006-02-21):

documentation:

* COPYING: Updated FSF address.

Omega 0.9.3 (2006-02-16):

documentation:

* overview.txt: The U prefix (URL term) was grouped with the date searching
  prefixes, but it makes more sense to group it with the prefixes relating to
  parts of the URL (H for hostname, P for path, etc).

* overview.txt: Add pointer to documentation of the supported query syntax.

* omegascript.txt: Improve descriptions of $cgi, $collapsed, $value, $version.

* termprefixes.txt: Fix typo.

indexers:

* omindex: add --preserve-nonduplicates / -p option to not delete any documents
  that aren't updated, in replace duplicates mode (so that multiple runs of
  omindex on different subsites don't stomp on each other).

* omindex,scriptindex: Add "--stemmer" option to omindex and scriptindex
  to allow the stemming language to be set.  Fixes bug#11.

* omindex,scriptindex: More consistent --help and --version output.

* omindex: Add support for OpenDocument format mimetypes and extensions out of
  the box.  Previously you could index them but had to pass a "-m" option for
  each OpenDocument filename extension you wanted to handle.

* scriptindex: The "-q" option no longer actually controls anything.  Just
  ignore it for backwards compatibility (and don't document it in --help).

omega:

* If executing an OmegaScript command causes a Xapian exception to be thrown,
  catch it and copy the error message into error_msg (which is read by the
  $error command).  This allows such errors to reported in a nicer way.

* Added "SORTREVERSE" CGI parameter which allows the sort order to be reversed
  when sorting on a value.  Removed "SORTBANDS" CGI parameter since it no
  longer does anything.

* Added	$find{LIST,STRING} to return the subscript of the first occurence of
  string STRING in list LIST.

* Added $lookup{CDBFILE,KEY} OmegaScript command to perform a lookup in a CDB
  file.

* Added new feature which allows you to avoid storing fieldnames in every
  document.  Instead you just store the field values, one per line, and add
  something like "$set{fieldnames,$split{caption sample url}}" to the
  OmegaScript template to specify the fieldnames to use.  This can save a lot
  of disk space for a large database.

* Add new "$split{}" OmegaScript command which splits a string to give an
  OmegaScript list.

* Fix $url{} to escape "+" to "%2b".  Also fix encoding of top-bit-set
  characters on platforms where char is signed by default.

* Speed up $highlight{} - only compare terms which are the same length.

* Reduce memory usage if a lot of documents are marked as relevant.

templates:

* query: Make the page title shorter so there's more chance it will fit on icon
  bars, etc.

* opensearch: Add missing escaping.

* godmode: If a non-existent docid is specified, report the error and prompt
  the user to enter another docid.  Fixes bug#60.

portability:

* omega: Fix printf type mismatch on 64 bit platforms.

* omega: Cast time_t to unsigned long to avoid problems on 64bit platforms.

* Use snprintf where available.

* Write top-bit set characters using \xXX notation to avoid warnings from
  Intel's C++ compiler.

Omega 0.9.2 (2005-07-15):

* omega: Changed $highlight so if OPEN and CLOSE aren't specified, they default
  to highlighting each word from the query with a different background colour
  like gmane does (previous default was to use '<strong>' and '</strong>').

* omega: Call QueryParser::set_database() as this is now used to decide what to
  do for terms like "C#".

* omega: Added the ability to set boolean prefixes for the QueryParser by
  setting a "boolprefix" map in the omegascript template.

* omega: Added $length{} and $stoplist{} commands to OmegaScript.

* scriptindex: Fix infinite loop if there's no newline at the end of a dumpfile.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Explain how to use termprefixes with scriptindex and
  omega, since that's what most people will want to know.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Use standard "S" prefix for title in example for
  $setmap, rather than "XT".

Omega 0.9.1 (2005-06-06):

* Releases are now created using libtool 1.5.18 and automake 1.9.5.

* Updated RPM packaging.

Omega 0.9.0 (2005-05-13):

* Updated for 0.9.0 API changes.

* omindex/scriptindex: Generate terms like "c#".

* Added mbox2omega script which allows a mail folder to be indexed using
  scriptindex.  Mostly it's an example as there's no mechanism included to show
  the full original message.

omega:

* The configuration file is now looked for differently - you can now set
  the environmental variable OMEGA_CONFIG_FILE.  See docs/overview.txt for
  details.

* $highlight can now highlight terms like "C#".

* Add new template 'opensearch' to implement basic opensearch feeds of search
  results.

omindex:

* URL hashing previously depended on sizeof(long) so databases weren't totally
  portable between platforms.  This is now fixed, but to do so we've had to
  break compatibility with databases built on platforms with 64 bit longs
  with URLs > 228 bytes.

* Removed useless "DUPE_duplicate" option.

* Added support for indexing Perl "pod" documentation using pod2text.

* Replaced -l/--no-recurse with -l/--depth-limit which takes an argument
  allowing recursion to be restriction to any depth, not just 0 or infinity!

* Extend -M/--mime-type to allow an existing mapping to be removed by omitting
  the type.

* Fixed code so that we get lstat() prototype on Linux systems where we have
  posix_fadvise().

scriptindex:

* Improved handling of extra blank lines in dump file.

* Strip multiple \r characters from end of line.

* Complain if a dump file doesn't appear to have been = escaped correctly.

* Flush database after each input file to ensure all changes from a file
  make it in.

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.txt: Clarify $field description slightly.

* docs/cgiparams.txt,docs/omegascript.txt: Fixed 3 references to OmXxxx classes.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Added a single document covering all aspects of term
  prefixes.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Moved $collapsed into correct place alphabetically!

* docs/cgiparams.txt,docs/overview.txt: Improved description of how B filters
  are handled when building the query.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Note that actions are applied in the specified order.

Omega 0.8.5 (2004-12-23):

* README,INSTALL: Proper installation instructions.

* omega: If an exception is thrown, make sure that the HTTP headers
  get written so that we don't cause "500 Internal Server Error".
  This problem was introduced by the change to allow a user specified
  Content-Type in 0.8.0.  Partly addresses bug#60.

* scriptindex: Fixed "Unknown Exception" when trying to "unhtml" text which
  contains "</body>" (bug#61).  This bug was introduced in 0.8.4.

* omindex/scriptindex: <h1> - <h6> and </h1> - </h6> now leave a space in the
  dumped HTML.  This bug was introduced in 0.8.4 - before that any tag left
  a space in the dumped HTML.

* omindex: Only try to delete removed documents in "replace duplicates" mode
  (which is the default).

* omindex: Change behaviour of crawler such that it doesn't follow symbolic
  links any more.  The new "--follow" command line option turns following of
  symlinks back on.

* dbi2omega: Add a comment to the start of the file detailing what
  dbi2omega does.

Omega 0.8.4 (2004-12-08):

* omindex,scriptindex: Improved HTML to text conversion - now we strip
  leading and trailing whitespace and convert all other consecutive groups of
  whitespace to a single space.  Also the parser now knows that some tags
  should be regarded as word breaks and some shouldn't (previously all tags
  were treated as word breaks).

* omindex: Removed bogus extra line from code which was meant to
  truncate samples, titles, etc at a word boundary, but has never actually
  worked!

* omindex: Added hooks for indexing the following formats: OpenOffice (requires
  unzip), MS Word (requires antiword), Wordperfect (requires wpd2text), RTF
  (requires unrtf).

* omindex: If a filename to be passed to a filter program has a leading "-",
  protect it from possible interpretation as an option by prepending "./".

* omega: When there's only a boolean query we promote it to be the query.
  Tweaked so we use boolean weights in this case.

* omega: Use Query::empty() instead of the now deprecated Query::is_empty().

* omega,omindex,scriptindex: Use the new Database/WritableDatabase
  constructors.

* templates/godmode: Finished off godmode template.

* Compile everything as C++.

* Check snprintf actually works - some older versions don't implement C90
  snprintf semantics.

* XAPIAN_FLAGS already links with xapianqueryparser so remove
  -lxapianqueryparser from omega_LDADD as it was causing link errors on cygwin.

Omega 0.8.3 (2004-09-20):

* scriptindex: --version now actually reports the version.  --help now exits
  with status 0 rather than status 1.

* RPM packaging: Updated.  The most notable change is that the RPM is now
  called xapian-omega because there's already an omega RPM (in Fedora Core at
  least) which is a game.  Also htdig2omega and htdig2omega.script are now
  included in the RPM.

* Install htdig2omega.script in ${prefix}/share/omega/ rather than
  ${prefix}/share/.

Omega 0.8.2 (2004-09-13):

* omega: $highlight now handles accented characters (bug#9).

* omega: Use new checkatleast parameter to Enquire::get_mset to implement
  MINHITS.

* omindex: When running with "replace duplicates" mode (the default), detect
  documents removed since the last indexing run and delete them from the
  database (bug #34).

* omindex: Use the new WritableDatabase::replace_document(term, doc) method.

* scriptindex: Report index script file name and line number when
  reporting errors in it.  Added warning for redundant actions,
  such as "truncate" as the last action in a rule.

* templates/query: Always report if the database is not found - previously we
  only did so if there was a query.

* templates/query: Fixed missing </center> tag which happened in certain cases.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Added note about that $add{$hit,1} gives
  the "hit number".

* Now includes htdig2omega and htdig2omega.script which allow you to crawl
  remote websites with ht://dig, then build a searchable index of them with
  Xapian and Omega.

* Link with -lxapianqueryparser, not -lomqueryparser.

Omega 0.8.1 (2004-06-30):

* omindex: Renamed hash() to hash_string() to avoid colliding with something
  on IRIX.

* omega: Changed MORELIKE to pick up to 40 terms, rather than up to 6 (feedback
  on the mailing list suggests this gives much better results).

* scriptindex: Added explicit catch for std::bad_alloc.

Omega 0.8.0 (2004-04-19):

* scriptindex: Change default to *not* overwriting the database (use
  --overwrite if you really want to do this); -u is now accepted but ignored.

* scriptindex: Use getopt for option parsing.

* omindex: Added --overwrite option which forces an existing database to be
  deleted before indexing begins.

* templates/xml: Correct spelling of `relavence' to `relevance'.  NB: if you're
  parsing the XML output, you'll need to fix this spelling in your parser!

* templates/xml: Now set HTTP header: "Content-Type: application/html".

* templates/xml: Remove unused OmegaScript code:
  `$set{topterms,$or{$ne{$msize,0},$query}}'.

* indextext.cc,omindex.cc,scriptindex.cc: Updated to use add_term() instead of
  add_term_nopos().

* omega: Added $httpheader Omegascript to allow arbitrary HTTP headers and
  alternative Content-Type headers to be specified.

* omega: If the probabilistic query was bad, don't try to run the match.

* omega: Don't crash if there's a date filter but no probabilistic query.

* omindex/scriptindex: Raw terms with a multicharacter prefix are now indexed
  with a : inserted (e.g. as XFOO:Rterm).  This matches what the query parser
  does.

* omindex/scriptindex: Don't create R terms for terms which start with a digit.

* omindex: Use O_STREAMING and/or posix_fadvise() when reading files to be
  indexed (if available).  This helps to keep the Xapian database in cache,
  and should greatly improve indexing throughput.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Make more explicit that boolean produces a *single*
  boolean term.

* docs/cgiparams.txt: Note that START and END should be in the format YYYYMMDD.
