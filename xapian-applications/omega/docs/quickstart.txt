Basic instructions:
===================

1.      Use omindex to build an index of your website:

$ omindex --db DBPATH --url / WEBPATH

Where DBPATH is where you want the database, such as
/var/lib/omega/data/default and WEBPATH is the directory containing
all your web documents - e.g. /var/www.

To start off with, it is advisable to have the final directory of the
database be called 'default'.  This is what Omega expects, although it
can be changed once you've got things going.

2.      Edit omega.conf:

This contains 3 settings, written one per line as "<SETTING> <VALUE>":

* database_dir - this should point to the directory containing your database,
  such as /var/lib/omega/data (it should contain the 'default' directory
  that is the actual database you indexed to above).

* template_dir - where the templates are - e.g. /var/lib/omega/templates

* log_dir - the directory which the omegascript $log command writes log files
  to - e.g. /var/log/omega

3.      Test omega from the command line:

$ /usr/lib/omega/bin/omega 'P=my search terms' HITSPERPAGE=10

(The path to omega may be different in your installation.)

You then get a large-ish HTML file.  Normally you use omega via CGI, but it
also has this test mode which is useful for checking that everything works
independent of your webserver configuration.  To actually use omega, you
should install it to run via CGI by copying or linking the omega executable
into your cgi-bin directory.

For more information, see overview.txt.  Descriptions of the CGI parameters
which omega accepts are in cgiparams.txt, and omegascript.txt describes the
OmegaScript language used to control the format of omega's output.
