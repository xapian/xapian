Description: CGI search interface and indexers using Xapian
 This package contains:
  - the "omega" CGI application which provides a customisable web interface for
    searching Xapian databases.
  - the "omindex" tool for indexing a directory tree of documents into a Xapian
    database in a form suitable for searching with omega.
  - the "scriptindex" indexer, which takes a simple text input format
    representing documents as a set of fields, together with an "index script"
    file specifying actions to be performed on each field, and indexes the
    documents into a Xapian database.
  - some example scripts for converting data from different sources into a form
    suitable for processing with "scriptindex".
