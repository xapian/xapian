voc.txt was derived in part from a dump of the Indonesian wikipedia by the
script wikipedia-most-common-words like so:

WikiExtractor.py idwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2
cat text/*/* | scripts/wikipedia-most-common-words 7 ascii > voc.txt

The dump used was dated April 2nd 2018.

31 examples given in the paper which weren't already in the generated voc.txt
have been added.

output.txt was generated from voc.txt by running it through the stemmer:

stemwords -l indonesian -c UTF_8 -i indonesian/voc.txt -o indonesian/output.txt
