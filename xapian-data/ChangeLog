	  wrote this two line note.

	* stemming/romanian.st: Oops - also remove corresponding word from the
	  expected output file, or it won't work.

Thu Mar 29 17:49:44 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* stemming/romanian.voc: Remove sample word which had a capital
	  letter, since stemtest doesn't cope with these.

Tue Mar 27 14:49:28 BST 2007  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* stemming/romanian2.st,stemming/romanian2.voc: Remove romanian2

	  changes character set to UTF-8, and updates some of the stemmings
	  to reflect changes in the snowball stemmers.

Mon Oct 14 00:04:54 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* stemming/: Use Snowball vocab lists instead of the old Xapian ones;
	  removed stopword lists (we'll use the Snowball ones, but they want
	  to be in xapian-core which everyone downloads, not with the stemmer
	  test data which few people need).

Sun Oct 13 03:44:58 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* stemming/: Fixed layout of stopsource files where the muscat3.6
	  style "e^a" accents have been changed into "é" etc.

Sun Oct 13 03:34:09 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* stemming/: Updated files so that they are correct for the Snowball
	  stemmers (which use iso-8859-1 accents and produce slightly
	  different results).

Fri Apr 12 14:07:40 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>
