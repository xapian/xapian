Xapian-core 0.8.2 (2004-08-??):

up to: Thu Aug 19 14:09:28 BST 2004  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* matcher/localmatch.cc: Fixed problems handling termweights in
	  queries with the same term repeated (bug #37) and added
	  regression test (qterminfo2).

	* xapian.spec.in,debian/libxapianVERSION-dev.install,
	  extra/.cvsignore,extra/Makefile.am,extra/omparsequery.h,
	  include/Makefile.am,include/om/.cvsignore,include/om/dir_contents,
	  include/om/om.h,m4/xapian.m4: Removed the compatibility layer which
	  allowed programs written against the pre-0.7.0 API to be compiled.

	* bin/,backends/quartz/,tests/quartztest.cc: QuartzCursor no longer
	  automatically reads the tag - you have to call read_tag() to
	  get it read.  This speeds up iterator over all the terms in
	  a database.  Also commented out QuartzCursor::prev as it's
	  unused and untested (at least in its latest form).

* Fixed to compile when configured with --disable-inmemory (bug #33).

	* backends/quartz/btree.cc,backends/quartz/btree.h: Don't redundantly
	  store next_revision - it's always just revision_number + 1.
	* backends/quartz/btree.cc,backends/quartz/btree.h: Calculate and
	  store the latest revision number, rather than storing the other
	  one and working out which is newer every time we're asked.

	* backends/quartz/btree.cc: Implemented Btree::cancel directly rather
	  than closing and reopening the Btree.

	* backends/quartz/quartz_database.cc,
	  backends/quartz/quartz_database.h: Added tunable flush thresholds
	  - set XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD=5000 to flush every 5000 documents
	  or XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD_LENGTH=1000000 to flush every 1000000
	  total change in document length.  Set both to flush whichever is
	  reached first.  Set neither and the default is to flush every
	  1000 documents as before.

* Reworked quartztest's positionlist1 into a generic api test as apitest's
  poslist3.

	* quartz: Eliminated QuartzBufferedTable and refactored the code to
	  reduce the number of classes and improve maintainability.  This
	  speeds up building databases.
	  Changed Btree::create() to remove any pre-existing alternate base
	  file, so we no longer need to call Btree::erase before
	  Btree::create.
	  Removed no-longer-used Btree::erase and
	  QuartzTable::erase methods.
	* backends/quartz/,bin/quartzcheck.cc,bin/quartzcompact.cc,
	  bin/quartzdump.cc,tests/btreetest.cc,tests/quartztest.cc,
	  testsuite/btreecheck.cc,testsuite/btreecheck.h: Eliminated
	  QuartzTable which had become just a thin wrapper around Btree.

* XO_LIB_XAPIAN now AC_SUBSTs XAPIAN_VERSION.

* API: Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document can now be used
  to add a document with a specific docid (to allow keeping docids
  in sync with numeric UIDs from another system).

* API: Added Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document and
  delete_document variants which take a unique id term name rather
  than a document id.

* docs/: Various minor updates and improvements.

* Improved API documentation for Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document and
  delete_document.

* Updated quartz design docs to reflect recent changes.  Also pulled
  out the Btree and Bcursor API docs and slotted them in as doxygen
  documentation comments - this way they're much more likely to
  be kept up-to-date.

Xapian-core 0.8.1 (2004-06-30):

API:

* New method Xapian::Database::get_lastdocid which returns the highest used
  document id for a database (useful for re-synchronizing an indexer which
  was interrupted).  Implemented for quartz and inmemory.

* Xapian::MSet::get_matches_*() methods now take collapsing into account, and
  the documentation has been clarified to state explicitly that collapsing and
  cutoffs are taken into account (bug#31).

* Xapian::MSet: Need to adjust index by firstitem when indexing into items
  (bug#28).

* MSetIterator and ESetIterator are now bidirectional iterators (rather than
  just input iterators)

* Fixed post-increment forms of PostingIterator, TermIterator,
  PositionIterator, and ValueIterator so that *i++ works (as it must for them
  to be true input iterators).

* Xapian::QueryParser: If we fail to parse a query, try stripping out
  non-alphanumerics (except '.') and reparsing.

* Fixed memory leaked upon Xapian::QueryParser destruction.

* Removed several unused Xapian::Error subclasses (these were used by the
  indexer framework which we decided was a failed experiment).

testsuite:

* queryparsertest: Pruned near-duplicate queryparsertest testcases.

* queryparsertest: Added test case for `term NOT "a phrase'.

* remotetest: Use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost so that tcpmatch1 doesn't fail
  just because the network setup is broken.

* apitest: Make emptyquery1 check that Query("") causes an InvalidArgumentError
  exception.

quartz backend:

* Fixed bug which meant we sometimes failed to remove a posting when deleting
  or replacing a document.

* Fixed PostlistChunkReader to take a copy of the postlist data being read to
  avoid problems with reading data from a string that's been deleted.

* Fixed bug in postlist merging which could occasionally extend a postlist
  chunk to overlap the docid range of the next chunk.

* Eliminated the split cursor in each Btree object - we only actually need a
  single block buffer to handle splitting blocks.  This reduces the memory
  overhead of each Bcursor (and hence each QuartzPostList).

* Changed 2 calls to abort() to throw Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError instead,

* If Btree is writable, throw DatabaseCorruptError if we detect overwritten.

* Check the return value of fdatasync()/fsync()/_commit() and raise an error.
  If they fail, we really want to know as it could cause data corruption.

* Assorted clean ups, improved comments, debug tracing, assertions.

* When merging in postlist changes, removed an unneeded call to
  QuartzBufferedTable::get_or_make_tag() in a case when we're using a cursor
  which has already fetched the tag.

* Added SON_OF_QUARTZ define to disable incompatible changes to database
  formats by default, and use it to control the docid encoding for keys such
  that we're always inserting at the end of the table when added new documents.

* Reopening the readonly version of a writable Btree is now more efficient
  (we used to close and reopen all the files and destroy and recreate a lot
  of objects and buffers).

* Share file descriptors between the read and write Btree objects so that a
  quartz WritableDatabase now uses 5 fds rather than 10.

* Added configure test for glibc, because otherwise we need to include a header
  before we can check for glibc in order to define something we should be
  defining before we include any headers!  Defining _XOPEN_SOURCE on OpenBSD
  seems to do the opposite to Linux and *disable* pread and pwrite!

backends:

* Stripped out the session machinery - all that is actually required is to
  ensure that any unflushed changes are flushed when the destructor runs.

* A few other backend interface cleanups.

build system:

* Unified the shlib version numbers (the small benefit of tracking them
  individually makes it hard to justify the extra work required, and having one
  version simplifies debian packaging too).

* configure.in: Fix typo (STLPORT_CXXLAGS -> STLPORT_CXXFLAGS)

* Removed trivial m4/Makefile.am and and autoconf/Makefile.am and do the work
  from the top level Makefile.am instead.  It's easier to see the structure
  this way, and it also removes a couple of recursive make invocations which
  will speed up builds a little.

documentation:

* HACKING: Added a list of subtasks when doing a release.
  Currently it's always me that does this, but it may not always be
  and anyhow it'll help me to have a list to run through.

* include/xapian/database.h: Remove references to sessions in doxygen
  comments.

* docs/quickstart.html: Corrected lingering reference to "om.h" and
  note that we need <iostream>.

* docs/quickstartindex.cc.html,docs/quickstartexpand.cc.html,
  docs/quickstartsearch.cc.html: Add <iostream>.

* PLATFORMS,AUTHORS: Updated.

* docs/quartzdesign.html: Corrected various pieces of out of date
  information, and improved wording in a couple of places.

* docs/scalability.html: Removed the reference to the Quartz update bottleneck
  "currently being addressed for Xapian 0.8" as it's now been addressed!  Also
  reworded to remove use of first person (it was originally a message sent to
  the mailing list).

Xapian-core 0.8.0 (2004-04-19):

* Omega, xapian-examples and xapian-bindings now have their own NEWS files.

API:

* Throw an exception when an empty query is used to build in the binary
  operator Query constructor (previously this caused a segfault.  Added
  regression test.

* Made the TradWeight constructor explicit.  This is technically an API change
  as before you could pass a double where a Xapian::Weight was required - now
  you must pass Xapian::TradWeight(2.0) instead of 2.0.  That seems desirable,
  and it's unlikely any existing code will be affected.

* Added "explicit" qualifier to constructors for internal use which take a
  single parameter.

* Renamed Xapian::Document::add_term_nopos to Xapian::Document::add_term
  (with forwarding wrapper method for compatibility with existing code).

* The reference counting mechanism used by most API classes now handles
  creating a new object slightly more efficiently.

* Xapian::QueryParser: Don't use a raw term for a term which starts with a
  digit.

testsuite:

* apitest, quartztest: Added a couple of tests, and commented out some test
  lines which fail in debug builds.

* quartztest: cause a test to fail if there's still a directory after a call
  to rmdir(), or if there isn't a directory after calling mkdir().

* apitest: Check returned docids are the expected values in a couple more
  cases.  Improved wording of a comment.

quartz backend:

* We now merge a batch of changes into a posting list in a single pass which
  relieves an update bottleneck in previous versions.

* When storing the termlist, pack the wdf into the same byte as the reuse
  length when possible - doing so typically makes the termlist 14% smaller!
  This change is backward compatible (0.7 database will work with 0.8, but
  databases built or updated with 0.8 won't work with 0.7).

* quartzcheck: Check the structure within the postlist Btree as well as
  the Btree structures themselves.

* Reduced code duplication in the btree manager and btreechecking code.

* quartzdump: Backslash escape space and backslash in output rather than hex
  encoding them; renamed start-term and end-term to start-key and end-key;
  removed rather pointless "Calling next" message; if there's an error, write
  it to stderr not stdout, and exit with return code 1.

* Corrected a number of comments in the source.

* Removed several needless inclusions of quartz_table_entries.h.

* Removed OLD_TERMLIST_FORMAT code - it has been disabled for since 0.6.0.

* Removed all the quartz lexicon code and docs.  It's been disabled for ages,
  and we've not missed it.

build system:

* XO_LIB_XAPIAN autoconf macro can now be called without arguments in the
  common case where you want the test to fail if Xapian isn't found.

* Fixed the configure test for valgrind - it wasn't working correctly when
  valgrind was installed but was too a version to support VALGRIND_COUNT_ERRORS
  and VALGRIND_COUNT_LEAKS.

* GCC 2.95 supported -Wno-long-long and is our minimum recommended version, so
  unconditionally use -Wno-long-long with GCC, and don't test for it on other
  compilers (the old test incorrectly decided to use it with SGI's compiler
  resulting in a warning for every file compiled).

documentation:

* Updated the quickstart tutorial and removed the warning that "this
  document isn't up to date".

* docs/intro_ir.html: Added a link to "Information Retrieval" by Keith van
  Rijsbergen which can be downloaded from his website!

* docs/quartzdesign.html: Some minor improvements.

* docs/matcherdesign.html: Merged in more details from a message sent to the
  mailing list.

* docs/queryparser.html: Grammar fixes.

* Doxygen wasn't picking up the documentation for PostingIterator and
  PositionListIterator - fixed.  Added doxygen comments for Xapian::Stopper
  and Xapian::QueryParser.

* PLATFORMS: Updated with many results from tinderbox and from users.

* AUTHORS: Updated the list of contributors.

* HACKING: XAPIAN_DEBUG_TYPES should be XAPIAN_DEBUG_FLAGS.

* HACKING: Updated to mention that building from CVS requires
  `./configure --enable-maintainer-mode' (or use bootstrap).

* HACKING: Added notes about using "using", and pointers to a couple of useful
  C++ web resources.

portability:

* Solaris: Code tweaks for compiling with Sun's C++ compiler.

* IRIX: Code tweaks for compiling with SGI's C++ compiler.

* NetBSD mkdir() doesn't cope with a trailing / on the path - fixed our code to
  cope with this.

* mingw/cygwin: Only use O_SYNC (on the debug log) if the headers define it.

* backends/quartz/quartz_table_manager.cc: Fix for building on mingw.

* mingw: Added configure test for link() to avoid infinite loop in our C++
  wrapper for link.

* mingw and cygwin both need -Wl,--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc passing when
  linking.  Arrange for xapian-config to include this, and check that the ld
  installed is a new enough version (or at least that it was at configure
  time).  Also pass to programs linked as part of the xapian-core build.

* cygwin: Close a QuartzDatabase or QuartzWritableDatabase before trying to
  overwrite it - cygwin doesn't allow use to delete open/locked files...

* backends/quartz/quartz_termlist.cc: Use Xapian::doccount instead of
  unsigned int in set_entries().

* Database::Internal::Internal::keep_alive() should be
  Database::Internal::keep_alive().

* Make Xapian::Weight::Weight() protected rather than private as we want to be
  able to call it from derived classes (GCC 3.4 flags this, other compilers
  seem to miss it).

debug code:

* Open debug log with flag O_WRONLY so that we can actually write to it!

* backends/quartz/quartz_values.cc: Fixed problem with dereferencing
  a pointer to the end of a string in debug output.

Xapian 0.7.5 (2003-11-26):

API:

* Xapian::QueryParser now supports prefixes on phrases and expressions (e.g.
  author:(twain OR poe) subject:"space flight").

* Added missing default constructors for TermIterator, PostingIterator, and
  PositionIterator classes.

* Fixed PositionIterator assignment operator.

testsuite:

* queryparsertest: Added testcase for new phrase and expression prefix support.

* apitest: Added regression tests for API fixes.

backends:

* quartzcompact: Fix the name that the meta file gets copied to (was
  /path/to/dbdirmeta rather than /path/to/dbdir/meta).

build system:

* Changed to using AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.  If you're doing development work on
  Xapian itself, you should configure with "--enable-maintainer-mode" and
  ideally use GNU make.

* Fixed configure test for fdatasync to work (I suspect a change in a recent
  autoconf broke it as it relied on autoconf internal naming).

* Fully updated to reflect move of libbtreecheck.la from backends/quartz
  to testsuite.  btreetest and quartzcheck should build correctly now.

documentation:

* Added first cut of documentation for Xapian::QueryParser query syntax.

* Fixed incorrectly formatted doxygen documentation comments which resulted in
  some missing text in the collated API and internal classes documentation.

* Documented --enable-maintainer-mode and problems with BSD make in HACKING.

* Fixed typo in docs/scalability.html.

* PLATFORMS: Updated from the tinderbox.

omega:

* omega: Parsing of the probabilistic query is now delayed until we need some
  information from it.  This means that we can now use options set by the
  omegascript template to control the behaviour of the query parser.
  $set{stemmer,...} now controls the stemming language (e.g. $set{stemmer,fr})
  and $setmap{prefix,...} now sets the QueryParser prefix map (e.g.
  $setmap{prefix,subject,XT,abstract,XA}).

* omega: Fixed $setmap not to add bogus entries.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Expanded documentation of $set and $setmap to list
  values which Omega itself makes use of.

* omega: Cleaned up the start up code quite a bit.

* omega: Removed the unfinished code for caching omegascript command
  expansions.  Added code to cache $dbsize.  The only other value correctly
  marked for caching is already being cached!

Xapian 0.7.4 (2003-10-02):

API:

* Fixed small memory leak if Xapian::Enquire::set_query() is called more than
  once.

* Xapian::ESet now has reference counted internals (library interface version
  bumped because of this).

* Removed unused OmDocumentTerm::termfreq member variable.

* OmDocumentTerm ctor now takes wdf, and replaced set_wdf() with inc_wdf() and
  dec_wdf().

* Removed unused open_document() method from SubMatch and derived classes.

* Calls made by the matcher to Document::Internal::open_document() now use the
  lazy flag provided for precisely this purpose, but apparently never used -
  this should give quite a speed boost to any matcher options which use values
  (e.g. sort, collapse).

testsuite:

* Finished off support for running tests under valgrind to check for memory
  leaks and access to uninitialised variables.

* apitest: Sped up deldoc4.

* btreetest: Removed superfluous `/'s from constructed paths.

* quartztest: adddoc2 now checks that there weren't any extra values created.

backends:

* quartz: don't start the document's TermIterator from scratch on every
  iteration in replace_document().  Should be a small performance win.

* quartz: Pass 0 for the lexicon/postlist table when creating a termlist just
  to find the doc length.

* quartz: quartz_table_entries.cc: Removed rather unnecessary use of
  const_cast.

* quartz: quartz_table.cc: Removed unused variable.

* quartz: Improved encapsulation of class Btree.

build system:

* libbtreecheck.la now has an explicit dependency on libxapian.la.

* We now set the dependencies for libxapian correctly so that linking
  applications will pull in other required libraries.

* matcher/Makefile.am: Ship networkmatch.cc even if "make dist" is run from a
  tree with the remote backend disabled.

* configure.in: Sorted out tests for gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr using
  standard autoconf macros.

* configure.in: If fork is found, but socketpair isn't, automatically disable
  the remote backend rather than configure dying with an error.

* autoconf/: Removed various unused autoconf macros.

portability:

* xapian-config.in: Link with libxapianqueryparser before libxapian, since
  that's the dependency order.

* Removed or replaced uses of <iostream> and <iosfwd> in the library sources
  - we don't need or want the library to pull in cin and friends.

* extra/queryparser.yy: Fixed to build with Sun's C++ compiler.

* Make the dummy source file C++ rather than C so that automake tells libtool
  that this is a C++ library - vital for correct linking on some platforms.

* Makefile.am: Pass -no-undefined to libtool so that we can build build a DLL
  on MS Windows.

* configure.in: Fixed check for socketpair - we were automatically disabling
  the remote backend on platforms where socketpair is in libsocket
  (such as Solaris).

* Use O_BINARY for binary I/O if it exists.

* common/utils.h: mkdir() only takes one argument on mingw.

* common/utils.h,testsuite/backendmanager.cc: Touch file using open() rather
  than system().

* common/utils.cc: Fixed to compile if snprintf isn't available.

documentation:

* docs/scalability.html: Fixed slip (32GB should be 32TB);  Added note about
  Linux 2.4 and ext2 filesize limits.

* PLATFORMS: Updated.

* NEWS: Fixed a few typos.

bindings:

* xapian.i: using namespace std in SWIG parsed segment to sort out typemaps.

packaging:

* Updated RPM packaging.

omega:

* omega: $topdoc now ensures the match has been run; $date no longer ensures
  the match has been run.

* omega: Fixed to build with Sun's C++ compiler.

Xapian 0.7.3 (2003-08-08):

API:

* MSetIterator: Fixed MSetIterator::get_document() to work when get_mset() was
  called with first != 0 (regression test msetiterator3).

testsuite:

* internaltest: Changed test exception1 to actually test something (hopefully
  what was originally intended!)

* Added long option support to the testsuite programs (and quartzdump).

* Testsuite now builds on platforms for which we use our own stringstream
  implementation.

* Only use \r in test output if the output is a tty.

* Increased default timeout used by tests running on the remote backend from 10
  seconds to 5 minutes to avoid tests failing just because the machine running
  them is slow and/or busy.

* Fixed check for broken exception handling - we were getting "Xapian::"
  prefixed to one version and not on the other.

* tests/runtest: Set srcdir if it isn't already to make it easy to manually run
  test programs from a VPATH build.

* apitest: Check termfreq in allterms4.

backends:

* quartz: Fixed allterms TermIterator to not give duplicate terms when a
  posting list is chunked; added regression test (allterms4).

* quartz: Check for EINTR when reading or writing blocks and retry the
  operation.  This should mean quartz won't fail falsely if a signal is
  received (e.g. if alarm() is used).

build system:

* Renamed libomqueryparser to libxapianqueryparser - for backward compatibility
  we still provide a library with the old name for now.

* xapian.m4: Added XO_LIB_XAPIAN to replace OM_PATH_XAPIAN.  XO_LIB_XAPIAN will
  automagically enable use of "xapian-config --ltlibs" if A[CM]_PROG_LIBTOOL is
  used in configure.in.

* xapian-config: Now supports linking with libtool - using libtool means that
  the run-time library path is set and that you can now link with an
  uninstalled libxapian.  Also xapian-config will now work once xapian-core's
  configure has been run, rather than only after "make all".

* xapian-config: Now automatically tries to link libxapianqueryparser too.

* bootstrap: Removed bootstrap scripts in favour of top-level bootstrap which
  creates a top-level configure you can optionally use to configure all checked
  out Xapian modules with one command, and which creates a top level Makefile
  to build all checked out Xapian modules with one command.

* Added versioning information to libxapian and libxapianqueryparser.

* xapian-example/omega: Use libtool and XO_LIB_XAPIAN so we can link with an
  uninstalled Xapian, and so the run time load path gets built into the
  binaries (no need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH just because you install Xapian with
  a non-standard prefix).

* configure: Stop the API documentation from being regenerated when
  include/xapian/version.h changes (since it's generated by configure).

* Fixed "make dist" in VPATH builds.

portability:

* common/getopt.h: #include <stdlib.h>, <stdio.h>, and <unistd.h> before
  defining getopt as a macro - this avoids problems with clobbering prototypes
  of getopt() in system headers.

* bin/quartzcompact.cc: Need stdio.h for rename().

* languages/Makefile.am: Fixed compilation for compilers other than GCC.

* Moved rset serialisation into a method of RSet::Internal, so
  omrset_to_string() is now just glue code.  This eliminates the need for it to
  be a friend of RSet::Internal which Sun's C++ compiler didn't seem to be able
  to cope with.

documentation:

* Fix incorrect documentation comment for Enquire::set_set_forward().  (Looked
  like a cut&paste error)

* COPYING: Updated FSF address, and reinstated missing section: "How to Apply
  These Terms to Your New Programs"

* PLATFORMS: Updated some linux results: RH7.3 on x86, and Debian on alpha and
  arm; Updated FreeBSD success report; Updated with results from the tinderbox.

* docs/mkdoc.pl: Don't choke on a comment at the end of the DIST_SUBDIRS line
  in a Makefile.am.

* HACKING: Improved note about why libtool 1.5 is needed.

* HACKING: Added note about additional tools needed for building a
  distribution.

bindings:

* Fixed VPATH builds.

* python: Fixed to link with libomqueryparser.

* guile,tcl8: Updated typemaps to SWIG 1.3 style.

omega:

* omindex.cc: Added missing `#include <errno.h>'.

* omindex/scriptindex: Fixed signed character issue in accent normalisation.

* omindex: fixed memory and file descriptor leak on indexing a zero-sized file.

* omindex: Fixed sense of test for unreadable files.

* omindex: Improved log messages to distinguish re-indexed/added.

* omindex,omega,scriptindex: Fixed to compile with mingw.

* omindex: Fixed to compile with GNU getopt so we can build on non-glibc
  platforms.

examples:

* msearch: Quick fix to get mingw building going.

* getopt: Copied over our fixes for better C++ compatibility.

* simplesearch: Stem search terms.

* simpleindex: Fixed not to run words together between lines.

* simpleindex: Create database if it doesn't exist.

Xapian 0.7.2 (2003-07-11):

testsuite:

* Fixed NULL pointer dereference when a test threw an unexpected exception.

backends:

* Quartz: When asked to create a quartz database, try to create the directory
  if it doesn't already exist.  Then we don't have to do it in every single
  Xapian program which wants to create a database...

portability:

* common/getopt.h: Fixed to work better with C++ compilers on non-glibc
  platforms.

* common/utils.h: missing #include <ctype.h>

* Quartz: Defined _XOPEN_SOURCE=500 for GLIBC so we get pread() and pwrite().

* common/utils.h: Improved mingw implementation of rmdir().

documentation:

* PLATFORMS: Added MacOS X 10.2 success report.

* Improvements to doxygen-generated documentation.

bindings:

* Moved to separate xapian-bindings module.

* Added configure check for SWIG version (require at least 1.3.14).

* bindings/swig/xapian.i: Fixed over-enthusiastic automatic conversion of
  termname to std::string.

* PHP4 bindings much closer to working once again; updated guile and tcl8
  somewhat.

omega:

* omega: If the same database is listed more than once, only search the first
  occurrence.

* omega: use snprintf to help guard against buffer overflows.

Xapian 0.7.1 (2003-07-08):

testsuite:

* Fixed testsuite programs to not try to use "rm -rf" under mingw.

backends:

* Quartz: Use pread() and pwrite() on platforms which support them.  Doing so
  avoids one syscall per block read/write.

* Quartz block count is now unsigned, which should nearly double the size of
  database for a given block size.  Not tested this yet.

omega:

* omindex: Fixed compilation problem in 0.7.0.

documentation:

* Added new document discussing scalability issues.

* PLATFORMS: Updated.

Xapian 0.7.0 (2003-07-03):

API:

* Moved everything into a Xapian namespace, which the main header now being
  xapian.h (rather than om/om.h).

* Three classes have been renamed for better naming consistency:
  OmOpeningError is now Xapian::DatabaseOpeningError, OmPostListIterator is
  now Xapian::PostingIterator, and OmPositionListIterator is now
  Xapian::PositionIterator.

* xapian.h includes <iosfwd> rather than <iostream> - if you were relying on
  the implicit inclusion, you'll need to add an explicit "#include <iostream>".

* Replaced om_termname with explicit use of std::string - om_termname was just
  a typedef for std::string and the typedef doesn't really buy us anything.

* Older code can be compiled by continuing to use om/om.h which uses #define
  and other tricks to map the old names onto the new ones.

* Define XAPIAN_VERSION (e.g. 0.7.0), XAPIAN_MAJOR_VERSION (e.g. 0), and
  XAPIAN_MINOR_VERSION (e.g. 7).

* Updated omega and xapian-examples to use Xapian namespace.

queryparser:

* Xapian::QueryParser: Accent normalisation added; Improved error reporting;
  Fixed to handle the most common examples found in the wild which used to give
  "parse error".

bindings:

* Python bindings brought up to date - use ./configure --enable-bindings to
  build them.  Requires Python >= 2.0 - may require Python >= 2.1.

* Enabled optional building of bindings as part of normal build process.  Old
  Perl and Java bindings dropped; for Perl, use Search::Xapian from CPAN; Java
  JNI bindings will be replaced with a SWIG-based implmentation.

internal implementation changes:

* Removed one wrapper layer from the internal implementation of most API
  classes.

* Xapian::Stem now uses reference counted internals.

* Internally a lot of cases of unnecessary header inclusion have been removed
  or replaced with forward declarations of classes.  This should speed up
  compilation and recompilation of the Xapian library.

* Suppress warnings in Snowball generated C code.

* Reworked query serialisation in the remote backend so that the code is now
  all in one place.  The serialisation is now rather more compact and no longer
  relies on flex for parsing.

testsuite:

* Moved all the core library tests to tests subdirectory.

* apitest now allows backend to be specified with "-b" rather than having to
  mess with environmental variables.

* Testsuite programs can now hook into valgrind for leak checking, undefined
  variable checking, etc.

backends:

* Fixed parsing of port number in remote stub databases.

* Quartz: Improved error message when asked to open a pre-0.6 Quartz database.

* Quartz backend: Workaround for shared_level problem turns out to
  be arguably the better approach, so made it permanent and tidied up
  code.

build system:

* Build system fixed to never leave partial files in place of the expected
  output if a build is interrupted.

* quartzcheck, quartzdump, and quartzcompact are now built by "make" rather
  than only by "make check".

* xapian-config: Removed --prefix and --exec-prefix - you can't reliably
  install Xapian with a different prefix to the one it was configured with,
  yet these options give the impression you can.

miscellaneous:

* Fixed sending debug output to a file with XAPIAN_DEBUG_LOG with a value which
  didn't contain "%%" (%% expands to the current PID).

* Fixed Xapian::MSetIterator::get_collapse_count() to work as intended.

omega:

* omindex,scriptindex: Normalise accents in probabilistic terms.

* omindex: Read output from pstotext and pdftotext via pipes rather
  than temporary files to side-step the whole problem of secure temporary file
  creation; Use pdfinfo to get the title and keywords from when indexing a PDF;
  Safe filename escaping tweaked to not escape common safe punctuation.

* omindex: Implement an upper limit on the length of URL terms - this is a
  slightly conservative 240 characters.  If the URL term would be longer than
  this, its last few bytes are replaced by a hash of the tail of the URL.  This
  means that (apart from hopefully very rare collisions) urlterms should still
  be unique ids for documents.  This is forward and backward compatible for
  URLs less than 240 characters.

* omindex: Clean up processing of HTML documents:
  - Ignore the contents of <script> and <style> tags in HTML.
  - Strip initial whitespace in each tag in an HTML document.
  - Try not to split words in half when truncating title and summary.

* query.cc: Set STEM_LANGUAGE near the start of the file so it's easy
  for users to change until we get better configurability.

* omega: Replaced half-hearted logging support with flexible OmegaScript-based
  approach with new $log command.  Also added $now to allow the current
  date/time to be logged.

* templates/xml: added collapse info to xml template.

documentation:

* Assorted minor documentation improvements.

* PLATFORMS: Updated.

rpms:

* Improved RPM packaging of xapian-core and omega.

Xapian 0.6.5 (2003-04-10):

* OmEnquire: optimised the handling when sort_bands == 1 and fixed incorrect
  results in this and some other sorting cases; added some sorting testcases.

* OmMSetIterator: added get_collapse_count() which returns a lower bound on
  the number of items which were removed by collapsing onto the current item.

* OmStem: added default OmStem constructor and "none" language.  Both of these
  give a stemmer object which leaves terms unchanged which should allow for
  simpler logic in programs using Xapian.  The default constructor also removes
  the need to mess with pointers in some cases.

* Automatically disable the remote backend if we don't have fork() since the
  remote backend requires it in several places.

* Fixed to build with debug enabled.

* testsuite: fixed to still build when some backends are disabled.

* extra/parsequerytest.cc: Fixed to build with GCC 2.95.

* Testsuite: Added regression test for Quartz bug which caused problems with
  long terms on machines with signed chars.

* testsuite/index_utils.cc: Handling of ^x was just downright wrong due to a
  typo.

* Improved portability: Fix for 64 bit machines.  Fixed btreetest to build with
  older compilers lacking <sstream>.  Xapian is now much closer to building
  with Sun's CFront-based Sun Pro C++ compiler, and with a Linux to mingw
  cross-compiler.

* PLATFORMS: Updated with the results of many test builds.

* Improved RPM packaging of xapian-core and omega.

* Documentation: Use http://www.doxygen.org/ as URL for doxygen; Fixed bad link
  to our own website in overview.html; code_structure.html now only includes
  directories in the build system.

* HACKING: updated.

* Removed bugs/todo.xml, TODO, TODO.release, docs/todo.html, and
  docs/todo-release.html from the distribution.  Bugs and todo items will be
  tracked in Bugzilla instead.

* Install docs in /usr/share/doc/xapian-core instead of /usr/share/xapian-core.

* omega: If xP and P are both empty, there may be a boolean query, so don't
  force first page of hits.

* omega: Fixed off-by-one error in rounding down topdoc - it was possible to
  get to an empty page of hits if there were exactly a multiple of HITSPERPAGE
  matches and the matcher over-estimated the number of matches and Omega
  displayed page links.

* omega: Fixed handling of multiple DB parameters to be as documented.

* omega: Added $collapsed to report get_collapse_count() for the current hit.

* omega: Added $transform{} which does regexp manipulation (currently disabled
  until configure tests for regexp library are added)
	
* omega: Added $uniq{} to eliminate duplicates from a sorted list.
	
* omega: Don't force page 1 for a query with repeated terms!

* omega: removed duplicates from terms listed in term frequencies.

* omega: Added cgi parameter COLLAPSE to collapse on key values

* omega: Added $value{key[,docid]} support to omegascript

* omega: Renamed DATE1, DATE2, and DAYSMINUS to the more meaningful START, END,
  and SPAN (NB SPAN is days before END, or after START, or before today -
  whereas SPAN was before *DATE1* or before today).  The old parameters names
  are supported (with the original semantics) for now.

* omega: Actually install documentation!

* templates/query: propagate B boolean filters

* templates/godmode: removed link to EuroFerret image

* templates/godmode: added value dumping, for values from 0-255

* omindex: Report correct version number (was hard-wired to 1.0!)

* scriptindex: Allow '_' in fieldnames.  Diagnose bad characters in fieldnames
  better.

* dbi2omega: Added DBUSER and DBPASSWD environmental variable support so that
  password protected DBs can easily be used

* scriptindex.cc: added missing "#include <stdio.h>" which caused builds
  to fail for some platforms.

Xapian 0.6.4 (2002-12-24):

* Quartz backend: Fixed double setting of position list when updating a
  document with term position information (overall result was correct, just
  inefficient); when deleting a position_list, don't check if it's empty,
  just ask the layer below to delete it and let it handle the case when
  there's nothing to delete; Fixed unpacking of termlist on platforms where
  char is signed.

* OmQueryParser: Added support for searching probabilistic fields (using
  <field>:<term>); the unstem multimap now includes "." on the end of a
  term if it was there in the query.

* Don't include "om.h" as a dependency for the api docs since it's generated
  a configure time and the dependency was forcing users to regenerate the
  documentation, which requires doxygen to be installed.

* Bindings: Python bindings updated to work with the updated API (still
  disabled by default).

* Muscat 3.6 backend: Fixed to build with the new database factory functions;
  fixed compilation warnings; Muscat 3.6 DA and DB databases don't support
  positional information.  Instead of throwing an exception when we try to
  access it, return an empty position list (like a quartz database with no
  position information would).  This allows copydatabase to be used to convert
  a Muscat 3.6 database to a quartz one.

* Documentation: quartzdesign and todo list updated.

* quartzcheck: default mode changed to "v" rather than "+", since "+" is too
  verbose for a btree of any size; if you pass a quartz database directory,
  quartzcheck will now check all the tables which make up a quartz database.

* quartzcompact: new tool which makes a copy of a quartz database with full
  compaction turned on - this results in a smaller database which is faster
  to search.  The next update will result in a lot of block splitting though
  (since all blocks are as full as possible).

* omega: Added $unstem to map a stemmed term to the form(s) used in the query;
  $queryterms now only includes the first occurrence of each stemmed form;
  $prettyterm makes use of the unstem map; prefer MINHITS to MIN_HITS and
  RAWSEARCH to RAW_SEARCH since none of the other CGI parameter names have
  _ separating words (continue to support old names for now); fixed default
  template to not generate topterms twice, and fixed topterms to not stick
  outside the green box; corrected omegascript docs - it's $setrelevant
  not $set_relevant.

* scriptindex: index=nopos with new indexnopos action; index and indexnopos now
  take an optional prefix argument; index=nopos is handled specially for
  backwards compatibility; added new data action to generate terms for date
  range searching.

Xapian 0.6.3 (2002-12-14):

* Updated PLATFORMS and todo list.  Noted in HACKING that Bison 1.50 seems to
  work with Xapian.

* OmQueryParser now creates an "unstem" multimap to allow probabilistic
  query terms to be converted back to the form the user originally typed.

* Updated documentation for remote protocol description and the quickstart
  tutorial which were both very out of date.

* No longer use OmSettings to pass matcher parameters.  This completes the
  removal of OmSettings.

* Added workaround for problem with cursors sharing levels in the btree.
  This should fix sporadic problems with large databases (small databases
  have fewer btree levels so aren't affected).

* Stub databases now work again, though with a different format.  The new
  format allows multiple databases to be specified in the stub file.

* OmEnquire::get_eset() now takes a flags argument of bit constants |-ed
  together instead of 2 bools.

* Applied Martin Porter's better fix for the btree sequential addition bug
  which Richard fixed a few months ago.  Richard's fix resulted in a correct
  btree, but didn't always utilise space as efficiently as possible.

* Fixed the remote backend to handle weighting schemes after the OmSettings
  changes.  You can now even implement your own weighting scheme and use it
  with the remote backend provided you register it with SocketServer at
  runtime (this feature has been on the todo list for ages).

Xapian 0.6.2 (2002-12-07):

* Set env var XAPIAN_SIG_DFL to stop the testsuite installing its
  signal handler (may be useful with some debugging tools).

* backends/quartz/btree.cc: max_item_size wasn't being set due to
  some over-zealous code pruning.  It was defaulting to 0, and
  was causing the code to write off the end of allocated memory
  blocks.

* matcher/localmatch.cc: fixed handling of wtscheme() - we were
  trying to use it for the extra weights, and then double
  deleting it!

* common/omdebug.cc,common/omdebug.h: Fixed permissions on newly
  created log file (was getting 000!); Simplified class internals;
  Renamed env vars: OM_DEBUG_FILE is now XAPIAN_DEBUG_LOG,
  OM_DEBUG_TYPES is now XAPIAN_DEBUG_FLAGS (old versions still work
  for now).

* testsuite/testsuite.cc: Fixed so running "gdb .libs/apitest"
  finds srcdir (for an in-tree build at least).

* Fixed to compile with --enable-debug=full.

* docs/remote.html: Updated from OmSettings to factory functions.

* PLATFORMS: ixion is actually Linux 2.2.

* OmWritableDatabase now has a default constructor.

* Weighting scheme now specified by passing OmWeight object to OmEnquire.
  This also allows user weighting schemes (just subclass OmWeight and
  pass in an instance of this new class).  [This doesn't currently work
  with the remote backend.]

* No longer use OmSettings to specify parameters for constructing databases.
  Instead there's a factory function for each database type - temporary naming
  scheme is OmXxx__open(), mostly because it's easy to grep for later.
  Instead of create and overwrite flags, we pass in a value - a new possible
  opening mode is "create or open".  [At present stub databases and the
  machinery in InMemory to allow the multierrhandler1 test aren't working.
  Everything else should be.]

* OmEnquire::get_eset() takes parameters instead of an OmSettings object.

* Fixed reversed sense of use_query_terms (and fixed reversed sense test in
  apitest which meant this wasn't spotted).

* Documentation: Link to annotated class lists in doxygen generated
  documentation instead of the rather empty index pages; added doxygen
  markup so that apidoc now documents header files; updated todo list.

* Documentation: intro doc thing was very out of date in places - fixed.

* Omega: index .php files as HTML, with the PHP code stripped out; omindex
  return non-zero return code if an unexpected exception is caught; fixed
  HTML parser to not read one character past the end of the document in
  some cases; updated in line with OmSettings related changes to the API;
  Fixed $dbname to return "default" for the default database instead of "";
  templates/query: Removed now unused xDEFAULTOP hidden field, and superfluous
  "}"; dbi2omega now more efficient and can be restricted to listed fields.

Xapian 0.6.1 (2002-11-28):

* Fixed to compile with GCC 3.0.

* PLATFORMS: Updated.

Xapian 0.6.0 (2002-11-27):

* Quartz database backend: lexicon disabled (./configure CXXFLAGS=-DUSE_LEXICON
  to reenable it), and encoding schemes simplified and made more compact;
  extended and added test cases; minimum block size is now 2048 bytes (as
  documented before, but now we actually enforce this); btree checking code
  split off and only linked in when required; tidied up btreetest's output.

* Replaced our stemmers with those from Snowball.  These give better results,
  and are actively maintained by Martin Porter (who wrote the original Xapian
  stemmers too).  It also means that Xapian now has stemmers for Finnish,
  and Russian, and an implementation of Lovins' English stemmer.

* Assorted improvements to the documentation, especially the documentation
  of the internals of the Quartz backend.

* Removed the three uses of RTTI (typeid() and dynamic_cast<>) - one was
  totally superfluous, and the other two easily avoided.

* Omega and simpleindex example: limit probabilistic term length to 64
  characters to stop the index filling up with junk terms which nobody will
  ever search for.

* Omega: Added dbi2omega perl script to dump any database which perl DBI can
  access into the dump format expected by scriptindex.

Xapian 0.5.5 (2002-12-04):

* Fixed compilation with --enable-debug.

* Minor documentation updates.

* Omega: Fixed paging on default database; removed xDEFAULTOP from the query
  template as it's no longer used; removed bogus unmatched '}' from query
  template; added dbi2omega perl script to dump any database which perl DBI
  can access into the dump format expected by scriptindex; limit length of
  probabilistic terms generated to 64 characters.

Xapian 0.5.4 (2002-10-16):

* Fixed a compilation error with "make check" when using GCC 3.2.

* PLATFORMS: checked 0.5.3 works on OpenBSD and Solaris 7.

Xapian 0.5.3 (2002-10-12):

Notable changes: Improvements to the test suite, and internal code cleanups:

* Internal code cleanups on Quartz Btree implementation.

* Minor documentation updates (TODO and PLATFORMS updated; Martin Porter's
  stemming paper removed - see the Snowball site for background stemmer
  info).

* Implemented QuartzAllTermsList::get_approx_size().

* Removed a couple of occurrences of "using std::XXX;" from externally
  visible headers.

* With GCC, add warning flags "-Wall -W" rather than "-Wall -Wunused" (-Wall
  implies -Wunused anyway).  Fixed all the warnings this throws up, except in
  languages/ (that code is to be replaced with Snowball soon).

* Test suite: Disable colour test output if stdout isn't a terminal and
  reworked check for broken exception handling as the previous  version never
  seemed to fire.  Other assorted minor improvements.

* include/om/om.h is now removed on "make distclean" rather than "make clean".

Xapian 0.5.2 (2002-10-06):

Further improvements to documentation and portability:

* docs/: converted all text docs to HTML (except omsettings which will
  has odd markup (LaTeX?) and will probably soon be obsolete anyway).

* remote backend: Fixed handling of timeouts which are now in the past - fixes
  test failures with redhat/x86.

* quartz backend: now works on 64 bit platforms.

* test suite: try to spot mishandled exceptions and stop them causing bogus
  OMEXCEPT failures.

Xapian 0.5.1 (2002-10-02):

This release fixes features improved documentation and some build system
portability fixes.

* PLATFORMS: updated with more test results.

* docs/: tidied up layout of HTML documentation; converted the notes about
  BM25 into HTML; updated stemmer docs to reflect intention to use Snowball
  instead; included HTML versions of quickstart*.cc.

* automake 1.6.3 and autoconf 2.54 are now required for those working
  from CVS to fix a problem with the generated Makefiles and Solaris
  make.

* net/Makefile.am: Fixed building of readquery.cc from readquery.ll.

* buildall script is now deprecated - use the new streamlined bootstrap script
  in preference.

Xapian 0.5.0 (2002-09-20):

The last release of the software that is now known as Xapian was OmSee 0.4.1 on
November 24th 2000, not far from 2 years ago.

There's been a significant amount of development in this time, so we've
summarised the most notable changes and improvements:

  * The project is now called "Xapian". We've renamed the modules in the light
    of this change:

      + "om" is now "xapian-core"
      + "om-examples" is now "xapian-examples", and now contains small,
        instructive examples which demonstrate how to use Xapian to implement
        particularly features.
      + Added "xapian-applications" which contains larger sample applications

  * Much improved build system - should now build "out of the box" on many Unix
    platforms. Can now VPATH build with vendor tools on most platforms. Builds
    as cleanly as we can achieve with GCC 2.95.* (some bogus warnings due to
    compiler bugs). Should build without warnings on GCC 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2.

  * If using GCC, om/om.h now contains a check that the compiler used to build
    Xapian and the compiler used to build the application have compatible C++
    ABIs. So you get a clear error message early from the first attempt to
    compile a file rather than a confusing error from the linker near the end
    of the build.

  * RPM packages are now available. We intend to prepare Debian packages in the
    near future too.

  * xapian-config no longer support "--uninst". It's hard to make this work
    reliably and portably, and the effort is better expended elsewhere.
    Configure with a prefix and install to a temporary directory instead.

  * Xapian can now work with files > 2Gb on OSes which support them.

  * Restructured and reworked documentation.

  * Removed thread locks. We intend to be "thread-friendly" so different
    threads can access different objects without problems. In the rare event
    that you want to concurrently call methods on the same object from
    different threads you need to create a mutex and lock it. Thus the thread
    lock overhead is only incurred when it's necessary.

  * Indexgraph removed from core library. It will reappear as an add-on library
    at some point.

  * Omega's query parser has now been reworked as a separate library.

  * Terminology change - "keys" are now known as "values" to avoid confusion,
    since they're not like keys in a relational database. The exception is when
    a value is used as a key in some operation, e.g. "match_collapse_key".

  * Database backends:

      + Auto backend: can now be used to create a new database.
      + Auto backend: added support for "stub" databases - a text file
        specifying the settings for the database to be opened (particularly
        useful for allowing easy access to specific remote databases).
      + Quartz backend: many fixes and improvements, and the code has been
        cleaned up a lot. Implemented deleting of items from postlists.
      + Remote backend: implemented term_exists() and get_termfreq();
      + Multi-backend: the document length is now fetched from the sub-postlist
        rather than the database, which provides a huge speed-up in some cases.
      + Sleepycat backend: this experimental backend has been removed.
      + Muscat 3.6 backends: now disabled by default.

  * Tests:

      + Test cases added for most bug fixes and new features.
      + stemtest: rewritten in C++ rather than part C++, part perl. Now 15%
        faster.
      + includetest: removed - it's no longer useful now the code has matured.
      + Removed problematic leak checking from testsuite. We plan to use
        valgrind instead soon.
	
  * Matcher:

      + Fixed several matcher bugs which could cause incorrect results in some
        situations.
      + Fix bug in expander due to nth_element being called on the wrong
        element.
      + Added sorting within relevance bands to the matcher.
      + Matcher now calculates percentages differently, such that 100%
        relevance is actually achievable.
      + Matcher now uses a min-heap rather than nth-element to maintain the
        proto-mset. This is cleaner and more efficient.
      + New operator OP_ELITE_SET replaces match_max_or_terms option.
      + Implemented multiple XOR queries.
      + Add a new query operator, OP_WEIGHT_CUTOFF, which returns only those
        documents from a query which have a weight greater than a specified
        cutoff value.
      + Removed OmBatchEnquire from system: it may return at a later date, but
        for now it is simply out of date and a maintenance liability, and
        gives no significant advantage.
      + Added experimental match bias functors.

  * The API has been cleaned up in various places:

      + OmDocumentContents and OmIndexDoc merged to become OmDocument
      + OmQuery interface cleaned up
      + OmData and OmKey removed - methods which used them now just pass a
        string instead
      + OmESetItem replaced by OmESetIterator; OmMSetItem by OmMSetIterator;
        om_termname_list by OmTermIterator
      + OmDocumentTerm and OmDocumentParams removed
      + OmMSet::mbound replaced by OmMSet::matches_
        {lower_bound,estimated,upper_bound}, giving more information
      + Xapian iterators now have default constructors
      + Most API classes now have reference counted internals, so assignment
        and copying are cheap
      + OmStem now has copy constructor and assignment operator
      + and more...
