Welcome to Xapian
=================

Xapian's build system is built using GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool.
If you've installed other Open Source projects from source, you should
find yourself in familiar territory.  Building and installing involves
the following 3 simple steps:

 1) Run "./configure", possibly with some extra arguments (see below)
 2) Run "make" to build Xapian
 3) Run "make install" to install Xapian

Prerequisites
=============

You'll need to have zlib installed (http://www.zlib.net/) before you can build
Xapian.  The zlib library is very widely used, so you'll probably have it
installed already if you're using Linux, FreeBSD, or similar, but you may need
to install a "zlib development" package to get the zlib library headers.

We recommend using zlib 1.2.x as it apparently fixes a memory leak in
deflateInit2 (which Xapian uses) and decompression is supposed to be about 20%
faster than with 1.1.x, but it's pretty unlikely you'll have an older version
installed these days.

Xapian 1.1.0 and higher also requires a library which can generate UUIDs.
On FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Microsoft Windows, Xapian makes use of built-in UUID
APIs.  On other platforms, you need to install libuuid which you can find in
util-linux-ng (http://userweb.kernel.org/~kzak/util-linux-ng/).  On Debian and
Ubuntu, the package to install is uuid-dev, while on Fedora, it is
libuuid-devel (on older Fedora versions you instead need e2fsprogs-devel).

Compilers
=========

We aim to support compilation with any C++ compiler which conforms to ISO C++,
or a reasonable approximation to it.

If you're using MS Visual C++, see the Xapian download page for a link to
a set of suitable makefiles: https://xapian.org/download

If you're using GCC, we currently recommend GCC 4.1 or newer (this is the
oldest version we regularly test with).

The minimum required GCC version is 3.1 (2.95.2 and earlier don't have
the <sstream> header; 3.0 adds support for the <limits> header and has
<streambuf> as well as <streambuf.h>, but widespread adoption of GCC3
didn't happen until after 3.0, and 3.1 was released on 2002-05-15 so
we now require this as it eliminates some preprocessor conditionals which we
aren't able to test regularly as we don't have easy access to such old GCC
versions).  If you really still need to use an older version of GCC, Xapian
1.0.x should build with GCC 2.95.3 or GCC 3.0.x.

When using HP's aCC, Xapian must be compiled with -AA ("ANSI mode"), which
xapian-core's configure automatically detects and passes.  This means your code
must also be compiled with -AA (and "xapian-config --cxxflags" will include
"-AA" automatically in this situation).  Compiling with -AP (non-ANSI mode)
would require adjusting Xapian away from standard ISO C++, and is only required
if you need to link to Xapian and another library not available in -AA form.
HP recommend ISVs to supply libraries in -AA form, so this isn't a likely
scenario.

When building on IRIX with SGI's compiler, Omega has to be built with "-ptused"
in CXXFLAGS (this is now added automatically by Omega's configure).  You may
need to do the same when building your own applications.  We don't fully
understand the issues here yet, but perhaps "-ptused" should be automatically
set by xapian-config.  Feedback from developers on IRIX is invited.

Multi-Arch
==========

When using GCC on platforms which support multiple architecture, the simplest
way to select a non-default architecture is to pass a CXX setting to configure
which includes the appropriate -m option - e.g. to build for x86 on x86-64
you would configure with:

./configure CXX='g++ -m32'

Building in a separate directory
================================

If you wish to perform your build in a separate directory from the source,
create and change to the build directory, and run the configure script (in
the source directory) from the build directory, like so:

  mkdir BUILD
  cd BUILD
  ../configure

IRIX make doesn't handle this correctly - either build in the source tree or
use "smake -M" (or better still, just use GNU make if you have it installed!)

Options to give to configure
============================

--enable-assertions
	You should use this to build a version of Xapian with many internal
	consistency checks.  This will run more slowly, but is useful if you
	suspect a bug in Xapian.

--enable-backend-brass
--enable-backend-chert
--enable-backend-flint
--enable-backend-inmemory
--enable-backend-remote
	These options enable (or disable if --disable-backend-XXX is specified)
	the compiling of each backend (database access methods).  By default,
	all backends for which the appropriate libraries and OS support are
	available will be enabled.

_FORTIFY_SOURCE
---------------

When compiling with GCC, by default Xapian will be built with _FORTIFY_SOURCE
set to 2.  This enables some compile time and runtime checking of values passed
to library functions when building with GCC >= 4.1 and glibc >= 2.34 (some
Linux distros may have backported support to older GCC and/or glibc).  If you
wish to disable this for any reason, you can just configure like so:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0

Or you can set the "fortification level" to 1 instead of 2:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1

If you're disabling it because it causes problems, please also report this to
us (via the bug tracker or mailing lists).

-Bsymbolic-functions
--------------------

When compiling with GCC and using a sufficiently new version of ld, configure
we automatically cause -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions to be used when linking the
library.  This causes all references from inside the library to symbols inside
the library to be resolved when the library is created, rather than when the
shared library is loaded, which decreases the time taken to load the library,
reduces its size, and is also likely to make the code run a little faster.

Should you wish to disable this for some reason, you can configure like so
which disables the probe for -Bsymbolic-functions so it won't ever be used:

./configure xo_cv_symbolic_functions=no

If you're disabling it because it causes problems, please also report this to
us (via the bug tracker or mailing lists).

-fvisibility
------------

When compiling with GCC >= 4.0 for platforms which support symbol visibility,
we automatically pass -fvisibility=hidden to g++ when building the library, and
mark classes, methods, and functions which need exporting with attributes to
make them visible.

Should you wish to disable this for some reason, you can configure like so:

./configure --disable-visibility

If you're disabling it because it causes problems, please also report this to
us (via the bug tracker or mailing lists).

Compiling with STLport
======================

C++ implementations have improved significantly since we started writing
Xapian, and these days the STL which comes with your compiler should work well.

But if you wish, you can use STLport instead.  STLport is a freely available
replacement C++ STL implementation, downloadable from:

http://stlport.sourceforge.net/

To compile with STLport:

 1) Install STLport, either from a package if your operating system has one,
    or by downloading the source, and compiling and installing it.

 2) Tell Xapian to use STLport when you configure in, like so:

    ./configure CXXFLAGS='-I/usr/include/stlport -pthread' LDFLAGS=-lstlport

    Replace /usr/include/stlport with the path to the STLport headers if they
    are in a different location.

 3) Compile Xapian as normal, by running make.

 4) You'll also need to compile code which uses Xapian with STLport, by
    arranging for the options above to be passed to the compiler when you
    compile and link that code.

Note that, unless you compile statically, you must make sure that the
STLport library is on the library path at runtime.  If it isn't by
default, on Linux you could do this by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable to point to the directory containing the STLport library.

Developers
==========

There are additional scripts and configure options to help people doing
development work on Xapian itself, and people who are building from git.
Read HACKING to find out about them.
