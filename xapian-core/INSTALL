Welcome to Muscat
=================

Muscat uses a standard GNU automake / autoconf / libtool / etc setup.
This means that all you need to do to compile a standard distribution
should be:

 1) Run ./configure, possibly with some extra arguments (see below)
 2) Run make
 3) Run make install to install Muscat


Options to give to configure:
=============================

Note: If you wish to perform your build in a separate directory from the
source, change to the build directory, and run the configure script
(in the source directory) from the build directory.

ie: mkdir BUILD; cd BUILD; ../configure

--enable-debug
	You should use this to build a version of muscat with debugging
	symbols and assertions to help with debugging.  Recommended for
	initial development with muscat - this helps to ensure that you
	are using the API correctly.
	(Note: This is currently the default option, due to the early
	stage of development of this project.)

--enable-backend-*
	These options enable the compiling of each of the backends.  (Database
	access methods.)  Use "./configure --help" to get a full list of
	the backends.  By default, all backends for which the appropriate
	libraries are available will be enabled.


Compiling with STLport
======================

If your native C++ standard library and STL is not suitable for your needs,
you should use an alternative library.  For example, you may wish to run
Muscat in a multithreaded situation and have the GNU libstdc++, which
doesn't work properly with multithreaded access.

One freely available option is STLport, downloadable from
http://www.stlport.org/

To compile with STLport:

 1) Download, build, and optionally install STLport.
 2) Configure muscat, by running ./configure, supplying the following
    arguments.

    --with-stlport=<path>, where <path> is the path to the STLport
        software.  The directory pointed to by <path> should contain
        stlport/ and lib/ subdirectories.

    --with-stlport-compiler=<name>, where <name> is the name of the
        compiler you are using.  This must correspond to the compiler
        name in the name of the STLport library.  For example, with
        GCC, the STLport library would be called libstlport_gcc, and
        you should give --with-stlport-compiler=gcc.

 3) Compile and use muscat as normal, by running make.

Note that, unless you compile statically, you must make sure that the
STLport library is on the library path at runtime: on Linux you could
do this by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point
to the directory containing the library.


Developers:
===========

There are additional scripts and configure options to help developers and
people who are building from CVS.  Read HACKING to find out about them.
