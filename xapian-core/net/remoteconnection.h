 *  after we've finished using it.  This class performs this initialisation when
 *  constructed and cleans up when destructed.  Multiple instances of the class
 *  may be instantiated - windows keeps a count of the number of times that
 *  WSAStartup has been successfully called and only performs the actual cleanup
 *  when WSACleanup has been called the same number of times.
 *
 *  Simply ensure that an instance of this class is initialised whenever we're
 *  doing socket handling.  This class can be used as a mixin class (just
 *  inherit from it) or instantiated as a class member or local variable).
