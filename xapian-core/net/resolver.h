	// AI_ADDRCONFIG which POSIX doesn't:
	//
	//   "The loopback address is not considered for this case as valid
	//   as a configured address."
	//
	// Some platforms implement this version rather than POSIX (notably
	// glibc on Linux).  Others implement POSIX (from looking at the
	// man pages, these include FreeBSD 11.0).
	//
	// In most cases, this extra sentence is arguably helpful - e.g. it
	// means that you won't get IPv6 addresses just because the system
	// has IPv6 loopback (and similarly for IPv4).
	//
	// However, it behaves unhelpfully if the *only* interface
	// configured is loopback - in this situation, AI_ADDRCONFIG means
	// that you won't get an IPv4 address (as there's no IPv4 address
	// configured ignoring loopback) and you won't get an IPv6 address
	// (as there's no IPv6 address configured ignoring loopback).
	//
	// It's generally rare that systems with only loopback would want
	// to use the remote backend, but a real example is testsuites
	// (including our own) running on autobuilders which deliberately
	// close off network access.
	//
	// To allow such cases to work on Linux (and other platforms which
	// follow the RFC rather than POSIX in this detail) we avoid using
	// AI_ADDRCONFIG for 127.0.0.1, ::1 and localhost.  There are
	// other ways to write these IP addresses and other hostnames may
	// map onto them, but this just needs to work for the standard
	// cases which a testsuite might use.
