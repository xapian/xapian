NearPostList::get_wdf() const
{
    // Calculate an estimate for the wdf of a near postlist.
    //
    // The natural definition of the wdf for a near postlist is the number of
    // times the terms occur in a group within the windowsize in the document -
    // in other words, the number of times a routine like do_test() could find
    // a match, if it kept going after finding the first one.  However,
    // calculating this would be expensive (in CPU time at least - the position
    // lists are probably already read from disk), and the benefit is dubious
    // (given that the estimate here is probably only going to be used for
    // calculating the weight for synonym postlists, and it's not clear that
    // the above definition is exactly appropriate in this situation, anyway).
    //
    // Instead, we could do an estimate of this value, based on the lengths
    // of the position lists.  Rather than having to open the position lists,
    // we could use the wdfs, which will be the same value unless the wdfs have
    // been artificially inflated - in which case we probably want to use the
    // inflated value anyway (it will have been inflated to represent the fact
    // that this term is more important than others, so we should make use of
    // this hint).
    //
    // A reasonable way to calculate an estimate would be to consider the
    // document to be split into W (overlapping) windows, each 1 term apart,
    // and of the same length as the windowsize used for the phrase.  Then,
    // calculate the probability that each term is found in this window (as
    // Prob = wdf / doclen), multiply these probabilities to get the
    // probability that they're all found in the window, and then multiply by
    // the windowsize again to get an estimate.
    //
    // However, this requires the doclen, which won't always be available (ie,
    // if the weighting scheme doesn't use it, we won't have read it from
    // disk).
    //
    // Rather than force an access to disk to get the doclen, we use an even
    // rougher estimate: the minimum wdf in the sub-lists.  This is actually
    // the upper bound for the wdf (since the phrase can only occur the same
    // number of times as the least frequent of its constituent terms).
    //
    // If this estimate proves to give bad results, we can revisit this and try
    // a better approximation.
