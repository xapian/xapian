The island Java lies between Sumatra to the west and Bali to the East.

Java is the world's 13th largest island.

There are three main languages spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, and
Madurese.

The origins of the name "Java" are not clear. One possibility is that the
island was named after the jawa-wut plant.

Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly
for client-server web applications.

Java is a programming language that runs on the JVM.

Java applications are typically compiled into bytecode that can run on any
Java virtual machine (JVM).

Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. All code is
written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of
the primitive data types.
