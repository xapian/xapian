// When building the library with GCC, generate preprocessor code to check that
// any version of GCC used to build applications has a matching C++ ABI. This
// means that users get a nice explanatory error message rather than a
// confusing link failure (or worse a program which builds but crashes).
// Another benefit is that the check happens near the start of compilation of
// the first source file which uses Xapian in the user's application, rather
// than during the first attempt to link with Xapian.
//
// We also check that the setting of _GLIBCXX_DEBUG matches since that
// introduces ABI-like incompatibilities.
//
// After preprocessing with "g++ -E" or similar (which will expand macros,
// strip comments such as this block, etc) we remove lines starting with a
// '#', remove blank lines, and collapse multiple spaces.  And we strip out
// double quotes, then replace '@@' with '"', and drop ',' at the end of a
// line (the purpose of the ',' is to prevent certain preprocessors from
// concatenating literal strings).
//
// So for lines we want in the output, we quote parts of the line which we
// don't want substituting, and use @@ where we really want " in the output.
