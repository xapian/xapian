 *  A Database object contains zero or more shards, and operations are

 *
 *  To perform a search on a Database, you need to use an Enquire object.
 *
 *  @since 1.5.0 This class is a reference counted handle like many other

 *	   to std::vector<database_shard>.  The key difference is that
 *	   previously copying or assigning a Xapian::Database made a deep copy,
 *	   whereas now it makes a shallow copy.
 *
 *  Most methods can throw:
 *
 *  @exception Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError if database corruption is detected
 *  @exception Xapian::DatabaseError in various situation (for example, calling
 *	       methods after @a close() has been called)
 *  @exception Xapian::DatabaseModifiedError if the revision being read has
 *	       been discarded
 *  @exception Xapian::NetworkError when remote databases are in use

     *
     *  A transaction is started with begin_transaction() and can either be

     *
     *  Closing the database (by an explicit call to close() or by its

     *  By default, commit() is implicitly called by begin_transaction() and
     *  commit_transaction() so that the changes in the transaction are
     *  committed or not independent of changes before or after it.
     *
     *  The downside of these implicit calls to commit() is that small
     *  transactions can harm indexing performance in the same way that
