/** Don't attempt to ensure changes have hit disk.
 *
 *  By default, Xapian ask the OS to ensure changes have hit disk (by calling
 *  fdatasync(), fsync() or similar functions).  If these calls do their job,
 *  this should mean that when WritableDatabase::commit() returns, the changes
 *  are durable, but this comes at a performance cost, and if you don't mind
 *  losing changes in the case of a crash, power failure, etc, then this option
 *  can speed up indexing significantly.
 */

/** Try to ensure changes are really written to disk.
 *
 *  Generally fsync() and similar functions only ensure that data has been sent
 *  to the drive.  Modern drives have large write-back caches for performance,
 *  and a power failure could still lose data which is in the write-back cache
 *  waiting to be written.
 *
 *  Some platforms provide a way to ensure data has actually been written and
 *  setting DB_FULL_SYNC will attempt to do so where possible.  The downside is
 *  that committing changes takes longer, and other I/O to the same disk may be
 *  delayed too.
 *
 *  Currently only Mac OS X is supported, and only on some filing system types
 *  - if not supported, Xapian will use fsync() or similar instead.
 */
const int DB_FULL_SYNC		 = 0x08;

/** Update the database in-place.
 *
 *  Xapian's disk-based backends use block-based storage, with copy-on-write
 *  to allow the previous revision to be searched while a new revision forms.
 *
 *  This option means changed blocks get written back over the top of the
 *  old version.  The benefits of this are that less I/O is required during
 *  indexing, and the result of indexing is more compact.  The downsides are
 *  that you can't concurrently search while indexing, transactions can't be
 *  cancelled, and if indexing ends uncleanly (i.e. without commit() or
 *  WritableDatabase's destructor being called) then the database won't be
 *  usable.
 *
 *  Currently all the base files will be removed upon the first modification,
 *  and new base files will be written upon commit.  This prevents new
 *  readers from opening the database while it unsafe to do so, but there's
 *  not currently a mechanism in Xapian to handle notifying existing readers.

/** When creating a database, don't create a termlist table.
 *
 *  For backends which support it (currently glass), this will prevent creation
 *  of a termlist table.  This saves on the disk space that would be needed to
 *  store it, and the CPU and I/O needed to update it, but some features either
 *  inherently need the termlist table, or the current implementation of them
 *  requires it.
 *
 *  The following probably can't be sensibly implemented without it:
 *
 *   - Database::termlist_begin()
 *   - Document::termlist_begin()
 *   - Document::termlist_count()
 *   - Enquire::get_eset()
 *
 *  And the following currently require it:
 *
 *   - Enquire::matching_terms_begin() - we could record this information
 *     during the match, though it might be hard to do without a speed penalty.
 *   - WritableDatabase::delete_document() - we could allow this with inexact
 *     statistics (like how Lucene does).
 *   - WritableDatabase::replace_document() if the document exists already
 *     (again, possible with inexact statistics).
 *   - Currently the list of which values are used in each document is stored
 *     in the termlist table, so things like iterating the values in a document
 *     require it (which is probably reasonable since iterating the terms in
 *     a document requires it).
 *
 *  You can also convert an existing database to not have a termlist table
 *  by simply deleting termlist.*.

 *  creates an empty read-only database - sometimes useful to avoid special
 *  casing this situation, but otherwise of limited use.  It's more useful
 *  when creating a WritableDatabase object, though beware that the current
