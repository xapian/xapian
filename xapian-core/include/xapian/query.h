	     *  If you want to implement a feature which finds documents
	     *  similar to a piece of text, an obvious approach is to build an
	     *  "OR" query from all the terms in the text, and run this query
	     *  against a database containing the documents.  However such a
	     *  query can contain a lots of terms and be quite slow to perform,
	     *  yet many of these terms don't contribute usefully to the
	     *  results.
	     *
	     *  The OP_ELITE_SET operator can be used instead of OP_OR in this
	     *  situation.  OP_ELITE_SET selects the most important ''N'' terms
	     *  and then acts as an OP_OR query with just these, ignoring any
	     *  other terms.  This will usually return results just as good as
	     *  the full OP_OR query, but much faster.
	     *
	     *  In general, the OP_ELITE_SET operator can be used when you have
	     *  a large OR query, but it doesn't matter if the search
	     *  completely ignores some of the less important terms in the
	     *  query.
	     *
	     *  The subqueries don't have to be terms, but if they aren't then
	     *  OP_ELITE_SET will look at the estimated frequencies of the
	     *  subqueries and so could pick a subset which don't actually
	     *  match any documents even if the full OR would match some.
	     *
	     *  You can specify a parameter to the query constructor which
	     *  control the number of terms which OP_ELITE_SET will pick.  If
	     *  not specified, this defaults to 10 (or
	     *  <code>ceil(sqrt(number_of_subqueries))</code> if there are more
	     *  than 100 subqueries, but this rather arbitrary special case
	     *  will be dropped in 1.3.0).  For example, this will pick the
	     *  best 7 terms:
	     *
	     *  <pre>
	     *  Xapian::Query query(Xapian::Query::OP_ELITE_SET, subqs.begin(), subqs.end(), 7);
	     *  </pre>
	     *
	     * If the number of subqueries is less than this threshold,
	     * OP_ELITE_SET behaves identically to OP_OR.

	     *  of the same term: so multiple matching terms for a document
	     *  increase the wdf value used, and the term frequency is based on
	     *  the number of documents which would match an OR of all the
	     *  subqueries.
