 *  When used for collapsing, the documents will only be considered equal if

 *  then the generated key will be empty, so such documents won't be collapsed
 *  (which is consistent with the behaviour in the "collapse on a value" case).
 *  If you'd prefer that documents with none of the keys set are collapsed
 *  together, then you can set @a reverse for at least one of the values.
 *  Other than this, it isn't useful to set @a reverse for collapsing.
