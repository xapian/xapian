<H1>The BM25 Weighting Scheme</H1>

<p>
This is a technical note about the BM25 weighting scheme, which is the default
weighting scheme used by Xapian.  Recent TREC tests have shown BM25 to be the
best of the known probabilistic weighting schemes.  In case
you're wondering, the BM simply stands for "Best Match".
</p>

<p>
We'll follow the evolution from the "traditional" probabilistic weighting
scheme (as described in the <a href="http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ser/papers/RSJ76.pdf">1976 Robertson/Sparck Jones paper</a>) through to BM25.
</p>

<H2>The Traditional Probabilistic Weighting Scheme</H2>

<p>
In its most general form, the traditional probabilistic term weighting function
is:
</p>

<table border=0><tr valign=center>
<td>
<tt><center>
<u>(k<sub>3</sub>+1)q</u><br>(k<sub>3</sub>+q)</center></tt>
</td>
<td><tt>&middot;</tt></td>
<td>
<tt><center>
<u>(k<sub>1</sub>+1)f</u><br>(k<sub>1</sub>L+f)</center></tt>
</td>
<td><tt>&middot;log</tt></td>
<td><tt><center>
<u>(r+0.5)(N-n-R+r+0.5)</u><br>(n-r+0.5)(R-r+0.5)</center></tt>
</td>
<td>
<tt>
&nbsp;...(1)
</tt>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>where:</p>

<p>
<tt>k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>3</sub> are constants.<br>
q is the wqf, the within query frequency,<br>
f is the wdf, the within document frequency,<br>
n is the number of documents in the collection indexed by this term,<br>
N is the total number of documents in the collection,<br>
r is the number of relevant documents indexed by this term,<br>
R is the total number of relevant documents,<br>
L is the normalised document length (i.e. the length of this document
divided by the average length of documents in the collection).
</tt>
</p>

<p>
The factors <tt>(k<sub>3</sub> + 1)</tt> and <tt>(k<sub>1</sub> + 1)</tt>
are unnecessary here, but help scale the weights, so the first component is 1
when <tt>q&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</tt> etc. But they are critical
below when we add an extra item to the sum of term weights.
</p>

<H2>BM11</H2>

<p>
Stephen Robertson's BM11 uses formula <tt>(1)</tt> for the term weights, but adds
an extra item to the sum of term weights to give the overall document
score:
</p>

<table border=0><tr valign=center>
<td><tt>k<sub>2</sub> n<sub>q</sub></tt></td>
<td>
<tt><center>
<u>(1-L)</u><br>(1+L)</center></tt>
</td>
<td>
<tt>
&nbsp;...(2)
</tt>
</td>
</tr></table>

<p>where:</p>

<p>
<tt>n<sub>q</sub> is the number of terms in the query (the query length),<br>
k<sub>2</sub> is yet another constant.
</tt>
</p>

<p>
Note that this extra item is zero when <tt>L&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</tt>.
</p>

<H2>BM15</H2>

<p>BM15 is BM11 with the <tt>k<sub>1</sub>+f</tt> in place of
<tt>k<sub>1</sub>L+f</tt> in <tt>(1)</tt>.</p>

<H2>BM25</H2>

<p>BM25 combines the B11 and B15 with a scaling factor, b, which turns BM15
into BM11 as it moves from 0 to 1:
</p>

<table border=0><tr valign=center>
<td>
<tt><center>
<u>(k<sub>3</sub>+1)q</u><br>(k<sub>3</sub>+q)</center></tt>
</td>
<td><tt>&middot;</tt></td>
<td>
<tt><center>
<u>(k<sub>1</sub>+1)f</u><br>(K+f)</center></tt>
</td>
<td><tt>&middot;log</tt></td>
<td><tt><center>
<u>(r+0.5)(N-n-R+r+0.5)</u><br>(n-r+0.5)(R-r+0.5)</center></tt>
</td>
<td>
<tt>
&nbsp;...(3)
</tt>
</td>
</tr></table>

<p>where:</p>

<p>
<tt>K = k<sub>1</sub>(bL + (1-b))</tt>
</p>

<p>
BM25 originally introduced another constant, as a power to which f and K are
raised.  However, Stephen remarks that powers other than 1 were
<i>'not helpful'</i>, and other tests confirm this, so Xapian's implementation
of BM25 ignores this.
</p>

<p>
<tt>(2)</tt> and <tt>(3)</tt> make up BM25, with which Stephen has had so
much recent success.
</p>

<p>
This does all seem somewhat ad-hoc, with so many unknown constants
in the formula.  But note that with <tt>k<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</tt>
and <tt>b&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</tt> we get the traditional formula anyway.
</p>

<p>
The default parameter values Xapian uses are
<tt>k<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</tt>,
<tt>k<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</tt>,
<tt>k<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</tt>,
and <tt>b&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5</tt>.  These are reasonable defaults, but the optimum
values will vary with both the documents being searched and the type of
queries, so you may be able to improve the effectiveness of your search system
by tuning the values of these parameters.
</p>

<p>
In Xapian, we also apply a floor to L (0.5 by default) which
helps stop tiny documents get ridiculously high weights.  And the matcher
wants the extra item in the sum to be positive, so we add
<tt>k<sub>2</sub>n<sub>q</sub></tt>
(constant for a given query) to (2) to give:
</p>

<table border=0><tr valign=center>
<td>
<tt><center>
<u>2 k<sub>2</sub> n<sub>q</sub></u><br>(1 + L)</center></tt>
</td>
<td>
<tt>
&nbsp;...(4)
</tt>
</td>
</tr></table>
