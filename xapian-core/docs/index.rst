Xapian - the open source search engine
======================================

Getting Started
---------------

There's a new
`Getting Started with Xapian <http://getting-started-with-xapian.readthedocs.org/>`_
guide, which is the recommended place to start.

Documentation
-------------

The Omega search application has its `own documentation
<https://xapian.org/docs/omega/>`_, and there's also separate
documentation for the `other language bindings
<https://xapian.org/docs/bindings/>`_.

We suggest you start by reading the `Installation
Guide <install.html>`_, which covers downloading the code, and
unpacking, configuring, building and installing it.

The `glossary <glossary.html>`_ provides definitions for specialized
terminology you might encounter while using Xapian.

The `Overview <overview.html>`_ explains the API which Xapian provides
to programmers.  A full `API Reference <apidoc/html/index.html>`_ is
automatically collated using doxygen from documentation comments in
the source code.  There's also a list of `deprecated features
<deprecation.html>`_ which lists features scheduled for removal, and
also features already removed, along with suggestions for
replacements.

If you want to learn more about information retrieval, there's a (reasonably
mathematical) `introduction to the ideas behind Xapian <intro_ir.html>`_ which
also suggests some books you might want to read.

There are a number of documents which cover particular features:

-  `BM25 Weighting Scheme <bm25.html>`_
-  `Collapsing <collapsing.html>`_
-  `Database Replication <replication.html>`_
-  `Faceting <facets.html>`_
-  `Indexing <termgenerator.html>`_
-  `PostingSource <postingsource.html>`_
-  `Query Parser <queryparser.html>`_
-  `Remote Backend <remote.html>`_
-  `Serialising Queries and Documents <serialisation.html>`_
-  `Sorting Results <sorting.html>`_
-  `Spelling Correction <spelling.html>`_
-  `Stemming Algorithms <stemming.html>`_
-  `Synonym Support <synonyms.html>`_
-  `Value Ranges <valueranges.html>`_

For those wishing to do development work on the Xapian library itself,
there is `documentation of Xapian's internals <internals.html>`_
available.

We also have a `wiki <https://trac.xapian.org/wiki>`_ for documentation
and examples contributed by the Xapian community.
