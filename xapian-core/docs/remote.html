<H1>Remote Backend</H1>

<P>This document describes how to make use of the facilities in Xapian
for distributed searches.

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>There are two sides to the distributed searching.  The client end is the
program initiating the search on behalf of a user, and the server end is
the program which provides a searching interface over a set of databases
for the client.  There can be many servers, with many clients sharing
them.  In theory, a server can also be a client to other servers, but
this may not be very useful or efficient.

<P>The client runs queries in the same way that it would on local databases
- the difference is in how the database is opened.
Once the database is opened, the query process is identical to any other.
Using a stub database with "auto" backend is a good way to wrap up access to
a remote database in a neat way.

<P>The remote backend currently support two client/server methods: prog and
tcp.  They both use the same protocol, although different means to contact
the server.

<H2>The Prog Method</H2>

<P>The prog method spawns a program when the database is opened, and
communicates with it over a pipe.  This can be used to connect to a
remote Xapian database across an SSH tunnel for example, providing
authentication and encryption.  The xapian-progsrv program is designed
to be the program at the far end of the connection.

<P>From the client end, create the database with <code>Xapian::Database database(Xapian::Remote::open(<i>program</i>, <i>args</i>));</code> - for example:

<pre>
Xapian::Database database(Xapian::Remote::open("ssh", "search.example.com xapian-progsrv /var/lib/xapian/data/db1"));
</pre>

<P>If the program has no path, the PATH environment variable is used.

<h2>The TCP Method</h2>

<P>The tcp method uses TCP/IP sockets to connect to a running server on a remote
machine (or indeed a local one, but that's rather pointless!)

<P>From the client end, create the database with <code>Xapian::Database database(Xapian::Remote::open(<i>host</i>, <i>port</i>));</code> - for example:

<pre>
Xapian::Database database(Xapian::Remote::open("searchserver", 33333));
</pre>

The host is the server's hostname, the port is the tcp port on the server to
use.

<P>The server is xapian-tcpsrv, which is installed by xapian-core's
"<code>make&nbsp;install</code>".
This should be started and left running in the background before searches
are performed.

<P>The arguments xapian-tcpsrv currently knows are:
<dl>
<dt> --port PORTNUM
<dd>        (required) the port to listen on.
<dt>    --one-shot
<dd>        Handle one connection, and then exit.  If --one-shot is not used,
	then the server runs until it is killed manually.
<dt>    --idle-timeout MSECS
<dd>	Set the timeout on a idle connection.
<dt>    --active-timeout MSECS
<dd>	Set the timeout waiting for responses when the connection is active.
<dt>    --timeout MSECS
<dd>	Set the idle and active timeouts to the same value.
<dt>    --quiet
<dd>	Minimal output.
</dl>
One or more databases need to be specified by listing their directories - they
are opened using the "auto" pseudo-backend.

<P>Once started, the server will run and listen for connections on the
configured port.  Each connection is handled by a forked child process
(or a new thread under Windows), so concurrent read access is supported.

<H2>Notes</H2>

<P>A remote search should behave just like the equivalent local one, except
a few features aren't currently implemented (e.g. spelling, synonyms, user
metadata).

<P>Exceptions are propagated across the link and thrown again at the client end.

<P>The remote backend now support writable databases.  Just start
<code>xapian-progsrv</code> or <code>xapian-tcpsrv</code> with the
option <code>--writable</code>.  Only one database may be specified.
