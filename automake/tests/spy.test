# Check whether double colon rules work.  The Unix V7 make manual
# mentions double-colon rules, but POSIX does not.  They seem to be
# supported by all Make implementation as we can tell. This test case
# is a spy: we want to detect if there exist implementations where
# these do not work.  We might use these rules to simplify the rebuild
# rules (instead of the $? hack).

# On a related topic, the Autoconf manual has the following text:
# |     `VPATH' and double-colon rules
# |           Any assignment to `VPATH' causes Sun `make' to only execute
# |           the first set of double-colon rules.  (This comment has been
# |           here since 1994 and the context has been lost.  It's probably
# |           about SunOS 4.  If you can reproduce this, please send us a
# |           test case for illustration.)

# We already know that overlapping ::-rule like
#
#   a :: b
#   	echo rule1 >> $@
#   a :: c
#   	echo rule2 >> $@
#   a :: b c
#   	echo rule3 >> $@
#
# do not work equally on all platforms.  It seems that in all cases
# Make attempts to run all matching rules.  However at least GNU Make,
# NetBSD Make, and FreeBSD Make will detect that $@ was updated by the
# first matching rule and skip remaining matches (with the above
# example that means that unless `a' was declared PHONY, only "rule1"
# will be appended to `a' if both b and c have changed).  Other
# implementations like OSF1 Make and HP-UX Make do not perform such a
# check and execute all matching rules whatever they do ("rule1",
# "rule2", abd "rule3" will all be appended to `a' if b and c have
# changed).

# So it seems only non-overlapping ::-rule may be portable.  This is
# what we check now.
