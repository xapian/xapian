# We have to distribute something in foo, because some versions
# of tar do not archive empty directories when passed the `o'
# flags.  (This was fixed in GNU tar 1.12, but older
# versions are still used: NetBSD 1.6.1 ships with tar 1.11.2).

# If sub/ is missing from the archive, config.status will fail
# to compute $ac_abs_srcdir during a VPATH build: config.status
# is able to create sub/ in the build tree, but it assumes the
# directory already exists in the source tree.
