# This test checks that dependent files are updated before including
# in the distribution. `parse.c' depends on `parce.y'. The later is
# updated so that `parse.c' should be rebuild. Then we are running
# `make' and `make distdir' and check whether the version of `parse.c'
# to be distributed is up to date.
