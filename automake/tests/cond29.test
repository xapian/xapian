# Check that many conditions do not lead to combinatorial explosion.
# (This is related to PR/352.)
#
# On this test, Automake 1.7.x would compute all 2**22 = 4194304
# possible combinations of conditionals (it would do this five times,
# to define a01_DEPENDENCIES, a02_DEPENDENCIES, a03_OBJECTS,
# a04_OBJECTS, and to rewrite bin_PROGRAM), eating all memory, swap,
# or cpu time it can found.  Although this test won't print `FAIL' if
# it fails, it will take long enough so it can't go unnoticed.
