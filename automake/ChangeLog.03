2003-12-31  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (generate_makefile): Update misleading comment.

	* automake.in (handle_languages): Define %DEPBASE% conditionally
	on subdir-objects.  Define SUBDIROBJ.  Do not clean *_.c files
	here ...
	(lang_c_finish): ... do it here.
	(handle_single_transform_list): Do not output specific rules for
	subdir-objects files which are not renamed.  This should reduce
	the size of Makefiles with lots of subdirectory sources.
	* lib/depcomp: Simplify computation of dependency output, and use
	DEPDIR.
	* lib/am/depend2.am (%EXT%.o, %EXT%.obj, %EXT%.lo): Adjust call
	to depcomp.  Compute depbase on-the-fly in generic fastdep rules
	for subdir-objects.
	* tests/ansi9.test: Do not grep for an explicit rule that
	we no longer expect.  Really run $MAKE to make sure the chain
	of rules works.
	* tests/yacc5.test: Do not grep for an explicit rule that
	we no longer expect.  Adjust to use set -e.

2003-12-27  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (@common_files): Move configure, configure.ac, and
	configure.in ...

2003-12-26  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (@copying): Do not repeat the version.
	(Top): Use @insertcopying.  Add a @detailmenu, this works around
	Emacs 21's inability to lookup indices in sub-nodes (reported
	by Kevin Ryde).
	(C++ Support, Assembly Support, Fortran 77 Support, Java Support,
	Support for Other Languages, Preprocessing Fortran 77, Compiling
	Fortran 77 Files, Mixing Fortran 77 With C and C++, How the Linker
	is Chosen): Add missing descriptions in menus.
	(Fortran 77 and Autoconf): Remove, this node was just saying "use
	Autoconf 2.53 or greater".

2003-12-09  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>  (tiny change)

	* doc/automake.texi (Local Macros, CVS): Typos.

2003-12-08  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (hook): Use $$ as prototype, not $\&.

	latter.
	* automake.in (var_SUFFIXES_trigger): Adjust registration via
	Automake::Variable::hook.
	(handle_texinfo_helper): Make sure `inner_expand => 1' appears

	%ac_config_files_location.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am ($(srcdir)/%CONFIG_HIN%): Rename as ...

	scan_autoconf_traces.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add confh5.test.
	* tests/confh5.test: New file.

	* tests/ltlibsrc.test: Fix the zoo_d_old2_la.c rule in Makefile.am,

	    Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	greedy in the suffix replacement regex.
	* doc/automake.texi (Default _SOURCES): New node.
	(Program Sources, Libtool Modules): Refer to it.
	* tests/ltlibsrc.test: Update to check for old default source files.

	for use in the absence of an appropriate _SOURCES declaration by
	first stripping any suffix from the unxformed target name, and
	appending `.c'.
	* doc/automake.texi (Program Sources, Libtool Modules): Document this.
	* tests/ltlibsrc.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add ltlibsrc.test.

2003-11-29  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (loc_and_value_as_list_recursive,
	_value_as_list_recursive_worker): Merge into ...
	(value_as_list_recursive): ... this function.  Pass options

	(handle_source_transform, handle_LIBOBJS, handle_ltlibraries)
	(handle_ltlibraries, handle_man_pages, handle_dist)
	(handle_gettext, am_install_var): Adjust usage of
	value_as_list_recursive.
	(handle_texinfo_helper): Pass inner_expand to
	value_as_list_recursive.
	* tests/txinfo28.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add txinfo28.test.
	Report from Ralf Corsepius.

2003-11-27  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi: More target vs. rule editing.  Back out some
	of the previous changes.  It's OK to talk about targets as "entry
	points", or as thing to build, but targets cannot be run: rules
	are run.

	* doc/automake.texi: s/target/rule/ where appropriate.  A target
	is the destination of a target rule, not the rule itself.
	Suggested by Bruno Haible.

2003-11-25  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (output): Add $(am__empty) to variable

	variables.

	* tests/subst2.test: New file.
	Report from Harlan Stenn.

	* lib/am/texibuild.am (%SOURCE_SUFFIX%.html): Work around a

	into ...
	(prepend_srcdir): ... this.
	(rewrite_inputs_into_dependencies): New function, extracted from ...
	(handle_configure): ... here.  Adjust to use prepend_srcdir

	* lib/am/configure.am (DIST_COMMON): Remove %MAKEFILE-IN%, it's
	already distributed by rewrite_inputs_into_dependencies.

	* tests/colon3.test: Use set -e.  Don't allow any AUTOMAKE
	invocation refer to zardoz.  Make sure two.in and three.in
	appear as $(srcdir)/two.in and $(srcdir)/three.in dependencies.
	* tests/distcom.test: Delete.  This is covered by tests/output9.test.
	* tests/output10.test: New file, for PR/411.

2003-11-21  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (append_exeext): Do not append $(EXEEXT) to
	@substitutions@.

	Fix the include guard substitution.
	* tests/yacc6.test: Augment to run ylwrap, and make sure it
	does not needlessly update headers.

	with ylwrap is not used.  Move `test -f foo.o' into the
	Makefile as `test -f foo.$(OBJEXT)' for portability.

	fill $ac_config_files_location.
	* tests/output8.test, tests/output9.test: New files.

	(scan_autoconf_traces, scan_autoconf_files, read_am_file):
	Update $configure_deps_greatest_timestamp and
	$output_deps_greatest_timestamp
	(generate_makefile): Rewrite the logic to decide whether

	else and didn't thought about removing it entirely.
	* tests/depcomp3.test: New file.

	(variable_conditions_recursive): Rewrite using

	$(top_distdir).

2003-01-19  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	Rename more files to accomodate 8+3 file systems, and adjust the

2003-01-14  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>
