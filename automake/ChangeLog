	(scan_autoconf_traces): Add AM_GNU_GETTEXT_INTL_SUBDIR to the list.
	Set $seen_gettext_intl when it is seen.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

2006-10-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/install-sh (posix_mkdir): Reject FreeBSD 6.1 mkdir -p -m,
	which incorrectly sets the mode of an existing destination
	directory.  In some cases the unpatched install-sh could do the
	equivalent of "chmod 777 /" or "chmod 0 /" on a buggy FreeBSD
	system.  We hope this is rare in practice, but it's clearly worth
	fixing.  Problem reported by Alex Unleashed in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-10/msg00012.html>.
	Also, don't bother to check for -m bugs unless we're using -m;
	suggested by Stepan Kasal.

2006-10-14  Geoffrey Keating  <geoffk@apple.com> (tiny change)

2006-10-09  Andreas Köhler  <andi5.py@gmx.net>  (tiny change)

	For PR automake/505:
	* lib/am/configure.am (am__CONFIG_DISTCLEAN_FILES):

2006-09-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/check.am (check-TESTS): Fix matching of XFAIL_TESTS
	against currently running test for the first and last element
	of $(TESTS): add spacing so Solaris make does VPATH expansion
	on these words, too.
	* tests/check6.test: Update.

2006-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	For PR automake/501:
	* lib/am/depend2.am (?GENERIC?%EXT%.o, ?!GENERIC?%OBJ%):
	Abbreviate output a bit by not bothering to quote the .Po file
	name (the quoting doesn't suffice in general anyway), and by not
	bothering to remove junk .Tpo files (as they'll be removed later).
	This also lets 'make' run faster by avoiding a subshell.

2006-08-30  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* automake.in: Fortran 77 and Fortran should require variables
	F77 resp. FC to be defined, and suggest the respective Autoconf
	macros otherwise.
	* tests/fort1.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	* tests/ext.test: Add extensions f95, F90, F95.

2006-08-30  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	For PR automake/500:
	* automake.in (handle_compile) <$default_includes>: Do not output
	the same -I twice.  Use @am__isrc@ instead of ` -I$(srcdir)'.
	* m4/init.m4: Define am__isrc as ` -I$(srcdir)' only in
	non-VPATH builds since we always have `-I.'.
	* tests/subpkg.test: Make sure config headers are found in VPATH
	and non-VPATH builds.

	lib/am/mans.am, lib/am/progs.am, lib/am/python.am,
	lib/am/scripts.am, lib/am/texinfos.am: Use MKDIR_P instead of mkdir_p.
	* m4/mkdirp.m4 (AM_PROG_MKDIR_P): Define mkdir_p using $MKDIR_P, not
	as '$(MKDIR_P)', otherwise it will break `Makefile.in's that use
	mkdir_p without defining MKDIR_P.
	* tests/distdir.test, tests/instman.test, tests/txinfo21.test:
	Adjust.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Build lib first, for lib/Automake/Config.pm.
	* configure.ac (ACLOCAL): Use --acdir=m4 in addition to

	* doc/automake.texi (Scripts): Fix some errors in previous patch.

	* doc/automake.texi (Scripts): Revamp.  Show an example of script
	built from configure.ac.  Discuss CLEANFILES and EXTRA_DIST for
	other built scripts.

	* m4/init.m4: Suggest fixing the call to AC_INIT when
	AC_PACKAGE_NAME or AC_PACKAGE_VERSION is undefined.  This is for
	newcomers who call AC_INIT and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE without arguments.
	* tests/init.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2006-08-04  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* automake.in (dist_dirs, fill_dist_dirs): Remove.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (DISTDIRS): Remove.
	* tests/distdir.test, tests/pr2.test: Do not grep, use
	`make distdir' instead.

2006-08-04  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Conditionals): Split in two sections, "Usage"
	and "Portability", and add a third one, "Limits" to explain how
	conditional definitions inside multi-lines definitions can be
	handled.
	* automake.in (handle_options): Do not assume that
	AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS is defined in TRUE, but diagnose conditional
	definitions of AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.
	Report from Bas Wijnen.
	* tests/amopt.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	* aclocal.in (install_file): Cannot use /dev/null while diffing
	new files, because Tru64's diff do not handle /dev/null.  So
	create an empty destination file before running diff on a new
	file, and erase it afterward.  Fall back to using /dev/null only
	if we cannot create this file.
	Report and initial patch from Ralf Wildenhues.
	(unlink_tmp): New function.
	* test/acloca18.test: Make sure the empty file has been erased.

2006-08-04  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* automake.in (handle_LIBOBJS_or_ALLOCA): With subdir-objects,
	do not prefix `$(top_builddir)/' aka `./' to nonempty LIBOBJDIR,
	to help BSD Make find the files also in a VPATH build.
	Also return the same path, possibly prefixed, for correct
	depdir computation.
	* tests/pr401.test: Update to expose wrong depdir computation.
	Rewrite to not use the same file name for library object and
	main program.
	* tests/pr401b.test, tests/pr401c.test: Likewise.

2006-07-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/install-sh: Don't incorrectly claim that this implementation
	can install only one file at a time.
	(doit_exec): New var, for using 'exec' if possible, to save a process.
	(test_mode, intermediate_mode): Remove.
	(mode): Check for IFS or globbing characters in mode, since they might
	cause weird behavior with the other changes below.  All later uses
	of '"$mode"' changed to '$mode', since the ""s no longer matter.
	Use octal modes if the invoker specifies an octal mode, and use
	octal umask values if 'umask' outputs octal values; this is more
	likely to work with older operating systems since Automake uses
	octal modes, and also works around a bug with HP-UX 11.23
	'mkdir -p -m u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx,u+wx' reported by Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-automake/2006-06/msg00024.html>.
	(cp_umask, mkdir_umask): New variables, to avoid
	temporarily creating files or directories with too-permissive modes.
	(mkdir_mode): Use the FreeBSD 'install' method for computing modes of
	intermediate directories; this is safer.
	(posix_mkdir): Also test mkdir -p -m ... by making a directory in
	/tmp and checking the resulting mode with 'ls', to catch a bug in
	HP-UX 11.23 and IRIX 6.5 mkdir reported by Ralf in the same message.
	Use ':' for true, not 'true'; this is a bit faster on
	traditional implementations.

2006-07-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* lib/depcomp: "in in" -> "in" in comment.

2006-07-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/defs.in (AUTOMAKE_run): Redirect stdout before stderr,

	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* m4/mkdirp.m4 (AM_PROG_MKDIR_P): Set `mkdir_p' to
	`'$(MKDIR_P)'', so that it retains the per-directory value
	computed by config.status.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): do not use `$(mkdir_p)' from
	a changed directory.  Bugs reported by Ralf Menzel.
	* THANKS: Update.

2006-06-24  Eric Dorland  <eric@debian.org>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* m4/mkdirp.m4 (AM_PROG_MKDIR_P): Rewrite using AC_PROG_MKDIR_P.

2006-06-06  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	    Ralf Wildenhues <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/distdir.am: Do not call $(mkdir_p) for each
	distributed file, collect them and create them in one run,
	and strip $(srcdir) and $(top_srcdir) all at once.
	Fix some comment typos.

2006-06-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* m4/depend.m4 (_AM_DEPENDENCIES): The IRIX MIPSpro compiler
	7.4.4m may omit the first included header dependency information
	with `-MDupdate'.  Refine test to catch this.

	* configure.ac (ACLOCAL): Use `-I m4' to match `./bootstrap'
	procedure.

	* tests/gettext.test: AM_PROG_GETTEXT of gettext >= 0.14.3
	requires `config.rpath' to be present, and automake now enforces
	this.  Test this, but only if the gettext installation works and
	is recent enough to provide this diagnosis.
	* tests/gettext.test: Provide a dummy `config.rpath' for all
	subsequent checks.
	* tests/gettext2.test, tests/subcond.test: Likewise.

	* tests/pr401.test: Replace "perl -i" with sed and mv, for
	MinGW perl.
	* tests/pr401b.test, tests/pr401c.test, tests/python11.test,
	* tests/yacc6.test, tests/yacc8.test: Likewise.

	* m4/depout.m4 (_AM_OUTPUT_DEPENDENCY_COMMANDS): Do not use
	plain `grep' on the Makefile, as its line length may exceed that
	for grep.  Bug report against coreutils by Sam Sirlin.
	* THANKS: Update.

2006-05-26  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>  (tiny change)

	* doc/automake.texi (Options): Add anchor `tar-formats'.

2006-05-25  Noah Misch  <noah@cs.caltech.edu>

	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm (lock): Allow EOPNOTSUPP, besides
	ENOLCK.  Only mention `make -j' when applicable.  Only raise
	fatal errors when `make -j' is involved.  Improve error message.

2006-05-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/Automake/Configure_ac.pm (find_configure_ac): Use
	`$configure_in' instead of `configure.in', to preserve
	directory component.
	* lib/Automake/Configure_ac.pm: Add note that Automake owns
	this file.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/Struct.pm: Likewise.

2006-05-16  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	lib/Automake/VarDef.pm, lib/Automake/Wrap.pm: Fix some typos.

2006-05-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/install-sh: Sync from Autoconf, as follows:
	Don't use 'path' to talk about file names,
	as per GNU coding standards.  Close a race condition reported by Ralf
	Wildenhues and Stepan Kasal.  There is still a race condition
	on hosts that predate Posix 1003.1-1992, but we can't help this.
	Don't mishandle weird characters like space on pre-Posix hosts.
	Invoke mkdir at most once per dir arg on pre-Posix hosts.

2006-05-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/missing.test, tests/missing2.test: Do not require
	GNUmake.
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check): Make sure `required=' does not
	follow `. ./defs' in the tests.

	* tests/ansi10.test: Use AC_PROG_CC_STDC.  Fix test that
	ac_cv_prog_cc_stdc isn't just used by Automake code in
	`configure'.
	* tests/ansi6.test, tests/ansi7.test: Likewise.
	* tests/ansi9.test: Likewise.  Do not override by setting
	$U and $(ANSI2KNR) at `make' time; that will be fragile.
	* tests/libobj8.test: Use AC_PROG_CC_STDC.
	* tests/subobj3.test: Likewise.  Use `set -e'.

	* lib/install-sh: Initialize IFS, so field splitting isn't
	turned off later.
	* lib/mkinstalldirs: Likewise.

	* lib/am/java.am (class%DIR%.stamp): Do not assume `$?' has
	the path of the prerequisite added; IRIX 6.5 make does not add
	it, Solaris 2.6 make is inconsistent about adding it.  Fixes
	java.test failure.

	* tests/distdir.test: Do not use leading `./' in EXTRA_DIST for
	files in the source tree.  Fixes failures with HP-UX and Tru64
	make.

	* lib/am/ansi2knr.am (ansi2knr): Rename target as...
	(./ansi2knr): ...this, for BSD make.
	(%ANSI2KNR-DIR%/ansi2knr): Adjust.

2006-05-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/depcomp6.test, tests/depcomp7.test: Cater for OpenBSD
	/bin/sh -e issue with failing commands in if clauses.

	* tests/defs.in (Be Bourne compatible): Update from current
	Autoconf.

	* configure.ac: Recommend perl-5.8.2.
	* tests/automake.test: Do not fail because of buggy Getopt::Long
	in perl < 5.8.2.

	* tests/longlin2.test: Do not use `grep' on Makefile.am:
	it has long lines and is thus not a text file; AIX 5.1 grep
	fails to scan non-plain patterns from long lines.

	* tests/overrid.test: Change all regexes for warning messages to
	match after a colon, so that the prepended file names do not
	cause false matches.  Tighten overrides regex.  Fix typo
	`cleam-am-local' -> `clean-am-local'.

	* tests/java.test: `configure' uses a trap, so use `(exit 77);
	exit 77' to portably set the exit status similar to AS_EXIT.
	* tests/fn99.test: propagate nonzero exit status from subshell.

	* tests/mkinst3.test: Fix `mkdir' wrapper to not be confused
	if ``pwd`' contains the string `-p'.  Create the wrapper in a
	subdirectory so that `.' in $PATH does not lead to an endless
	loop.

	* lib/depcomp (ia64hp): Rename dependency style to..
	(hp2): ..this, as it works with aCC on HPPA, too; adjust
	comment.  Report by Olivier Fourdan (PR automake/481).
	* THANKS: Update.

	* tests/aclocal7.test: Add `$sleep's between file touching
	and automake resp aclocal+automake invocations, to ensure
	they complete with a time stamp strictly later than the touched
	file.

	* lib/missing: Remove superfluous quotes.  Replace all uses of
	`[' by `test', for consistency, and for..
	* tests/missing5.test: ..this new test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	* lib/missing (sed_minuso, sed_output): New variables.
	(autom4te, help2man, makeinfo): Use them.  Unifies detection of
	`-o FILE', `--output FILE', `--output=FILE', stricter regex.
	Fixes `missing' to detect `--output' for help2man.  Fixes
	PR automake/483.  Report by Dennis J. Linse.
	(autom4te): Document in `missing --help'.
	* THANKS: Update.

	* lib/install-sh: Handle --, and diagnose unknown options.
	* m4/mkdirp.m4 (AM_PROG_MKDIR_P): In the normal case, set
	mkdir_p='mkdir -p', not to 'mkdir -p --', for consistency with
	the other ways that mkdir_p might be set.

2006-04-21  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* m4/amversion.in (_AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION): New macro.
	(AM_SET_CURRENT_AUTOMAKE_VERSION): Call it.
	* aclocal.in (trace_used_macros): Trace _AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION.
	(write_aclocal): Output a check for Autoconf's version in aclocal.m4.
	Doing so ensures that users cannot build configure and Makefiles
	with two different autoconf versions.  Report from Noah Misch.
	* tests/missing4.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2006-04-20  Paul Lunau  <temp@lunau.me.uk>  (tiny change)
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/dejagnu.am (check-DEJAGNU): Fail when at least one test

	Report from Paul Lunau.
	* tests/dejagnu4.test: Update to expose this.

	* tests/instspc.test: Major rewrite to test for many other
	problematic file names, e.g., '$', '"', '('.  Automake and
	Autoconf can't handle many of them, so do not report a failure
	if the usual candidates show up.

2005-07-10  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (define, _new): Remember the helper
	variable created for the last conditional += on each variable, and

	variable, not to older helper variables.  This way the order of
	the items appended to the variable is preserved.

	* tests/cond38.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cond38.test.
